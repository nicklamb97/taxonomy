  - question: What is a frame script in OpenROAD?
    answer: >
      A frame script is a script associated with a frame in OpenROAD. It can
      initialize local variables for the frame, perform start-up operations,
      include event blocks for events that apply to the frame as a whole, and
      include event blocks for events on individual fields or menu items.
  - question: What is the general syntax of a frame script?
    answer: |
      The general syntax of a frame script is:
      ```
      [initialize [([parameterlist])] =
      [declare
              [localvariablelist]
              [localprocedureforwardreferences]
      [enddeclare]]
      [begin
              statementlist
      end [;]]
      {eventblock [;]}
      {localprocedure [;]}
      {parameterlist [;]}
      {localvariablelist [;]}
      ```
  - question: What is the purpose of the initialize statement in a frame script?
    answer: >
      The initialize statement in a frame script initializes local variables and
      performs start-up operations for the frame. It must be the first statement
      in the frame script if used. The initialize statement can also declare
      parameters and local variables for use within the frame script.
  - question: How do you declare local variables in a frame script?
    answer: >
      Local variables are declared in the declare section of the initialize
      statement. The syntax is:

      ```

      declare
          localvariablelist
      enddeclare

      ```

      These local variables can be used anywhere in the frame script or in any
      field or menu item scripts associated with the frame.
  - question: How are event blocks used in frame scripts?
    answer: >
      Event blocks in frame scripts contain sequences of statements associated
      with specific events. The syntax for an event block is:

      ```

      on event [variablename]
          {, on event [variablename]} =
      [declare
              localvariablelist
      [enddeclare]]

      begin
              statementlist
      end[;]

      ```

      When the specified event occurs, OpenROAD executes the statements in the
      event block.
  - question: What is a typical frame event included in frame scripts?
    answer: >
      Typical frame events included in frame scripts are:

      - Terminate: Exits the frame

      - ChildEntry: Enters a subform, composite field, or any field on the form

      - ChildExit: Exits a subform, composite field, or any field on the form

      - ChildSetValue: Changes a subform, composite field, or any field on the
      form

      - FrameResized: Changes the size of the window

      - UserEvent: Specifies a user event
  - question: How do you handle a standard quit sequence in a frame script?
    answer: >
      A standard quit sequence in a frame script can be handled with the
      following event block:

      ```

      on click menu.file_menu.quit_menu,

      on click quit_button =

      begin
          return;
      end;

      ```
