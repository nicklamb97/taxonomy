  - question: What are field and menu item variables in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Field and menu item variables in OpenROAD are variables associated with the value in a field or menu item.
      They are not associated with the object represented by the field or menu item.
  - question: How are field and menu item variables created in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Field and menu item variables are created when you specify a variable name on the Property Inspector while
      creating a field or menu item in OpenROAD Workbench. OpenROAD declares them automatically, so it's not
      necessary to declare them in your scripts.
  - question: How can you set the value of a field variable in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      You can set the value of a field variable by directly assigning a value to it in your 4GL code. For example:
      title = 'Destry Rides Again';
  - question: How can you reference the object represented by a field or menu item instead of its value?
    answer: |
      To reference the object represented by a field or menu item instead of its value, use the FIELD() function
      with the field or menu item variable. For example:
      FIELD(title).BgColor = CC_ORANGE;
  - question: When does OpenROAD initialize variables?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD initializes variables in the following situations:
      1. When starting an application, it initializes any global variables associated with the application.
      2. When calling a frame or procedure, it initializes the variables associated with that frame or procedure.
  - question: How does OpenROAD determine the initial value for variables?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD uses the default value of the variable as the initial setting. For field and menu items or global
      variables, you can define this value in the OpenROAD Workbench. If not defined, OpenROAD uses system defaults.
      It also uses system defaults for variables declared in the initialize statement of a frame script.
  - question: What are the system default values for simple variables in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      For simple variables, the system defaults in OpenROAD are:
      - Zero for numeric data types
      - Empty string ('') for non-nullable character data types
  - question: Can you override the default initialization values for simple variables in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Yes, you can override the default initialization values for simple variables using the default clause.
      For example: i = integer not null default 3;
  - question: How are reference variables initialized in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      For reference variables, OpenROAD creates an object of the declared class and sets the reference variable to
      reference that object. The attributes of this object are initialized to their default values as specified in
      the class definition.
  - question: Can you set a reference variable to null during initialization in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Yes, for attributes that are reference variables, you can set the initial value of the variable to null.
      In this case, no object is created for the reference variable.
