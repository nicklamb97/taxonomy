  - question: What is a reference variable in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      A reference variable in OpenROAD is a variable that points to an object of a given class, allowing access to
      the value of an object. It doesn't store its own values but uses the values in the corresponding object when
      referenced.
  - question: How do you declare a reference variable in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      To declare a reference variable in OpenROAD, use the following syntax:
      name = class [ [with] default null]
      For example: strobj = StringObject;
  - question: Are reference variables nullable in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Yes, all reference variables in OpenROAD are nullable.
  - question: How can you access individual attributes of an object using a reference variable?
    answer: |
      To access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:
      referencevariable_name.attribute_name
      For example: customer.Address
  - question: What happens when you set a reference variable to null in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      When you set a reference variable to null in OpenROAD, it no longer points to any object. If all reference
      variables for an object are set to null or redirected, OpenROAD frees the associated object.
  - question: How can you check if a reference variable is null in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      You can check for a null reference variable using the 'is null' operator. For example:
      if a is null then
          /* processing statements */
      endif;
  - question: How can you create objects for reference variables in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      You can create objects for reference variables using the Create method, defined for the Class class. For example:
      a = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */
      a.Street = 'main street';
      a.City = 'dallas';
  - question: What happens when you declare a reference variable without specifying 'default null'?
    answer: |
      When you declare a reference variable without specifying 'default null', the variable points to an object whose
      attributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object.
  - question: Can you work with an entire object as a single unit using reference variables in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Yes, in OpenROAD, you can work with an object as a whole using reference variables. For example, you can pass
      the values in a subform's fields to a procedure by naming the variable as a procedure parameter.
  - question: What happens if you try to access an attribute that doesn't exist in a reference variable's class?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not
      contain those attributes. This helps catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime.
