  - question: What are the arithmetic operators supported in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD supports the following arithmetic operators:
      - `+`: Addition
      - `-`: Subtraction
      - `*`: Multiplication
      - `/`: Division
      - `**`: Exponentiation
  - question: How does operator precedence work for arithmetic operators in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The operator precedence for arithmetic operators in OpenROAD, from highest to lowest, is:
      1. `**` (Exponentiation)
      2. `*`, `/` (Multiplication and Division)
      3. `+`, `-` (Addition and Subtraction)
      Operators with equal precedence are processed from left to right. Parentheses can be used to force
      alternate precedence.
  - question: What is the string concatenation operator in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, the concatenation operator for joining string expressions is the plus sign (`+`).
      For example: answer = prompt 'Please enter department for ' + name + ': ';
  - question: What are the logical operators in OpenROAD and their precedence?
    answer: |
      The logical operators in OpenROAD are AND, OR, and NOT. Their precedence, from highest to lowest, is:
      1. NOT
      2. AND
      3. OR
      Parentheses can be used to change the order of evaluation.
  - question: What are some comparison operators in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Some comparison operators in OpenROAD include:
      - `=`: Equal to
      - `!=`, `<>`, `^=`: Not equal to
      - `<`: Less than
      - `<=`: Less than or equal to
      - `>`: Greater than
      - `>=`: Greater than or equal to
      - `is null`: Value is null
      - `is not null`: Value is other than null
      - `like`: Value matches a pattern-matching string
      - `not like`: Value doesn't match a pattern-matching string
  - question: How does the LIKE operator work in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The LIKE operator in OpenROAD compares two strings for resemblance. Its syntax is:
      charvar [not] like pattern [escape escapechar]
      It uses special characters in the pattern:
      - `_`: Matches any single character
      - `%`: Matches any string of characters, regardless of length
      - `[]`: Matches any character within the brackets (when preceded by escape character)
  - question: How can you test if a value is null in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, you can test if a value is null using the IS NULL operator. The syntax is:
      expression is [not] null
      For example:
      if salary is null then
          sal_msg = 'Salary amount is unknown.'
      endif;
  - question: Can OpenROAD perform date arithmetic?
    answer: |
      Yes, OpenROAD supports date arithmetic. For example, you can add days to a date like this:
      start_date = start_date + '2 days';
  - question: What is the result of True AND Null in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, the result of True AND Null is Null.
  - question: What is the result of False OR Null in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, the result of False OR Null is Null.
