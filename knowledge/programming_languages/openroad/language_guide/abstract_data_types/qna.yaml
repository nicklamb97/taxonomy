      The numeric string data type in OpenROAD is a virtual type that exists only when numeric data types are
      compared directly with character data. It allows character data to be treated as numeric if it's in a
      valid numeric form.

      1. TABLE_KEY: Values are unique within the table
      2. OBJECT_KEY: Values are unique within the database

      In OpenROAD:
      - TABLE_KEY values are returned as 8-byte strings
      - OBJECT_KEY values are returned as 16-byte strings
  - question: What are the restrictions on logical keys in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The restrictions on logical keys in OpenROAD include:
      1. A system_maintained logical key column cannot be created using the CREATE TABLE...AS SELECT statement
      2. The COPY statement cannot be used to load values from a file into a system_maintained column
  - question: How should logical keys be passed in a UTF-8 environment in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In a UTF-8 environment in OpenROAD, logical keys must be passed as type BYTE.
