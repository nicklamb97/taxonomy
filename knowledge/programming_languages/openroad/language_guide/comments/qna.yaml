  - question: What are the two types of comments in OpenROAD 4GL scripts?
    answer: |
      The two types of comments in OpenROAD 4GL scripts are:
      1. End-of-line comments
      2. Block comments
  - question: How do you write an end-of-line comment in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, you can write an end-of-line comment by preceding the comment with "//". For example:
      // This is a single-line comment
  - question: Can you use end-of-line comments to comment out multiple lines of code in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Yes, you can use end-of-line comments to comment out multiple lines of code in OpenROAD by preceding each
      line with "//". For example:
      //insert into employees(salary, age)
      //values(:salfield, :agefield);
      //commit work;
  - question: How do you start and end a block comment in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, a block comment begins with "/*" and ends with "*/". For example:
      /* This is a single-line block comment */
  - question: Can block comments span multiple lines in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Yes, block comments can span multiple lines in OpenROAD. For example:
      /*
      ** This is a multi-line block
      ** comment.
      */
  - question: Can you use block comments at the end of a line in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Yes, you can use block comments at the end of a line in OpenROAD. For example:
      insert into employees(salary, age)
      values(:salfield, :agefield); /*This is a comment*/
      commit work;
  - question: Can you nest comments in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      No, you cannot nest comments in OpenROAD.
  - question: What is the difference between end-of-line comments and block comments in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The main differences between end-of-line comments and block comments in OpenROAD are:
      1. Syntax: End-of-line comments use "//" while block comments use "/*" and "*/".
      2. Span: End-of-line comments are typically used for single lines, while block comments can easily span
         multiple lines.
      3. Usage: End-of-line comments are often used for brief explanations or to comment out single lines of code,
         while block comments are useful for longer explanations or commenting out larger blocks of code.
  - question: Where can you include comments in OpenROAD 4GL scripts?
    answer: |
      You can include comments anywhere in your OpenROAD 4GL scripts.
  - question: How can you comment out a partial line of code in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      You can comment out a partial line of code in OpenROAD by using an end-of-line comment. Simply add "//"
      after the code you want to keep, and the rest of the line will be treated as a comment. For example:
      insert into employees(salary, age) // This part will be executed
      values(:salfield, :agefield); // This is a comment
