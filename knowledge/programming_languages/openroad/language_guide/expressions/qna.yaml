  - question: What are expressions in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Expressions in OpenROAD are language constructs that resolve to a value, a set of values, or TRUE or FALSE.
      They can contain various language elements and are widely used in 4GL.
  - question: What types of language elements can be used in OpenROAD expressions?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD expressions can use various language elements, including:
      - Literals
      - Variables
      - Named constants
      - Values returned by procedures
      - Arithmetic and string expressions
      - Logical (boolean) expressions
  - question: Can OpenROAD use operators and functions from Ingres DBMS in expressions?
    answer: |
      Yes, OpenROAD allows the use of many operators and functions from the Ingres DBMS in expressions.
  - question: What are some ways expressions are used in OpenROAD's 4GL?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD's 4GL, expressions can be used in several ways:
      1. The value of an expression can be assigned to an OpenROAD variable
      2. Expressions can be used as part of a search condition in a query statement
      3. Expressions can serve as a condition in an OpenROAD if or while statement
  - question: What do expressions in OpenROAD typically resolve to?
    answer: |
      Expressions in OpenROAD typically resolve to:
      - A value
      - A set of values
      - TRUE or FALSE
  - question: Can arithmetic operations be part of expressions in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Yes, arithmetic expressions can be part of expressions in OpenROAD.
  - question: Are string operations allowed in OpenROAD expressions?
    answer: |
      Yes, string expressions are allowed in OpenROAD expressions.
  - question: Can logical or boolean operations be used in OpenROAD expressions?
    answer: |
      Yes, logical (boolean) expressions can be used in OpenROAD expressions.
  - question: Are expressions in OpenROAD limited to simple data types?
    answer: |
      No, expressions in OpenROAD are not limited to simple data types. They can involve complex elements like
      values returned by procedures.
  - question: How are expressions related to control structures in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Expressions in OpenROAD can serve as conditions in control structures such as if statements and while loops.
