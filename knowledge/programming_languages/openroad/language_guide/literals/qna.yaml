  - question: What are the three types of literals in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The three types of literals in OpenROAD are:
      1. String
      2. Numeric
      3. Date/time
  - question: How can you specify a Unicode literal in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, you can specify a Unicode literal using the U& notation followed by a string with escaped
      sequences of hex digits. For example: U&'Hello\202Fworld\+029E71'
      Alternatively, you can use the N'x' notation.
  - question: How are string literals specified in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      String literals in OpenROAD are specified by one or more characters enclosed in single quotes. The default
      data type for string literals is varchar.
  - question: How can you include a single quote inside a string literal in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      To include a single quote inside a string literal in OpenROAD, you must double it. For example:
      'The following letter is quoted: ''A''.'
  - question: What are the three types of numeric literals in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The three types of numeric literals in OpenROAD are:
      1. Integer
      2. Decimal
      3. Floating point
  - question: How are floating point literals specified in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Floating point literals in OpenROAD must be specified using scientific notation. The format is:
      [+|-] {digit} [.{digit}] e|E [+|-] {digit}
      For example: 2.3e-02
  - question: What is a named constant in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      A named constant in OpenROAD is a literal value to which you give a name. You can then use the name in place
      of the constant in any 4GL expression. Named constants are global to the application and their values are
      specified using the OpenROAD Workbench.
  - question: Can you change the value of a named constant at runtime in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      No, you cannot change the value of a named constant at runtime in OpenROAD. Although you can reference the
      named constant in your 4GL code, you must use the Constant Editor to change its value.
  - question: What are system variables in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      System variables in OpenROAD are built-in variables that are available in all frames and scripts. They
      provide information about the current execution context, errors, and query results.
  - question: Name five system variables available in OpenROAD.
    answer: |
      Five system variables available in OpenROAD are:
      1. CurEventScope
      2. CurFrame
      3. CurSession
      4. IIDBMSerror
      5. IIrowcount
