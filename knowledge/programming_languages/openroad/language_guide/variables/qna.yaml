  - question: What are OpenROAD variables used for?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD variables contain or point to data that the application manipulates. This can be data that is displayed
      to the user or used solely in scripts and procedures.
  - question: How are variables associated in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, a variable is associated either with the application (global variables) or with a specific frame,
      procedure, method, field script, or event block (local variables).
  - question: What are global variables in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Global variables provide data that is pertinent to the entire application and are available for use in any script
      or procedure. They are declared using the OpenROAD Workbench.
  - question: What are the types of local variables in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Local variables in OpenROAD include:
      1. Variables declared in the initialize statement for a frame or a field script
      2. Variables associated with field and menu items
      3. Variables declared in a procedure, method, or event block definition
  - question: How are variables associated with fields handled in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      When a variable is associated with a field on the displayed form, setting its value updates the display to show
      the new value. Conversely, referring to the variable reflects the current setting of the displayed form, including
      updates performed by the user.
  - question: What are the three types of variables in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The three types of variables in OpenROAD are:
      1. Simple variables
      2. Reference variables
      3. Dynamic array variables
  - question: How are variables associated with field and menu items declared?
    answer: |
      Variables associated with field and menu items are declared implicitly when you create the fields on a form. They
      can also be declared at runtime as described in the Language Reference Guide online help.
  - question: Where can you find more information about declaring global variables in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      More information about declaring global variables can be found in the Workbench User Guide.
  - question: What is the scope of variables declared in a procedure, method, or event block?
    answer: |
      Variables declared in a procedure, method, or event block are available for use only in the procedure, method, or
      event block that defines them.
  - question: How are frame variables different from field-associated variables?
    answer: |
      Frame variables, declared in the initialize statement for a frame or a field script, are not associated with
      fields and the information in them is not displayed to the user directly. In contrast, field-associated variables
      are displayed directly on the form.
