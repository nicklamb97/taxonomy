  - question: What are the four types of SQL functions in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The four types of SQL functions in OpenROAD are:
      1. Ingres scalar SQL functions
      2. Aggregate functions
      3. The ifnull() function
      4. The dbmsinfo() function
  - question: Where can Ingres scalar SQL functions be used in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Ingres scalar SQL functions can be used in all OpenROAD statements and in all SQL statements that are used
      locally within OpenROAD, except for object_key() and table_key().
  - question: How are aggregate functions used in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Aggregate functions, which take a set of values (for example, the contents of a column in a table) as their
      arguments, can only be used in OpenROAD within SQL statements.
  - question: How can OpenROAD access database functions from other systems like MSSQL or Oracle?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD can access database functions from other systems like Ingres, MSSQL, Oracle, as well as UDFs
      (user-defined functions) by using Execute Immediate Statement and Direct Execute Immediate Statement.
  - question: What's the difference between running a function on the client side versus the database side in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Running a function on the client side versus the database side can yield different results. For example:
      ld_date = DATE('now'); // returns the client current date and time
      SELECT :ld_date = DATE('now'); // returns the server current date and time
  - question: Does OpenROAD support all Ingres scalar functions?
    answer: |
      No, OpenROAD does not support many Ingres scalar functions. Although you can use them in SQL statements,
      OpenROAD cannot process them locally.
  - question: Can all OpenROAD 4GL functions be used in both 4GL programming and SQL statements?
    answer: |
      Most OpenROAD 4GL functions share the same name and functionality as the equivalent SQL function and can be
      used in both. However, some functions are specific to either 4GL or SQL. For example, the upper() function
      can be used in both, while count() is only for SQL and field() is only for 4GL.
  - question: How does OpenROAD handle the replace() string function?
    answer: |
      The replace() string function is currently available only in SQL statements in OpenROAD. OpenROAD runs the
      SQL SELECT on the server side and returns the result to the OpenROAD variable. For example:
      select :lv_searchString = REPLACE('I like bananas','bananas','apples');
  - question: What is the field() function in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The field() function is a non-SQL function supported by OpenROAD. It is available only in 4GL code and cannot
      be used in SQL statements.
  - question: Where can developers find more information about OpenROAD functions?
    answer: |
      For more information about OpenROAD functions, developers can refer to the Function Libraries documentation.
