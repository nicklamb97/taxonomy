  - question: What are the Unicode data types in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The Unicode data types in OpenROAD are nchar and nvarchar. These are used to store Unicode data in the
      UTF-16 form.
  - question: How do char and varchar handle Unicode data in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, char and varchar strings are encoded as single-byte or multi-byte forms based on the value of the
      II_CHARSETxx variable. If II_CHARSETxx is set to UTF8, these strings are encoded as UTF-8 strings.
  - question: What is the difference between UTF-16 and UTF-8 encoding in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD:
      - UTF-16 form encodes characters of fixed length, typically using 16 bits.
      - UTF-8 form encodes characters of variable width between one and three bytes per character.
  - question: What are the maximum lengths for different Unicode string types in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD:
      - The maximum Unicode UTF8-16 string is 16,000 characters.
      - The maximum Unicode UTF-8 string is 16,000 bytes (octets).
      - The maximum single-byte or multi-byte string is 32,000 bytes.
  - question: Can a Unicode UTF-16 string be coerced to other string types in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Yes, in OpenROAD:
      - A Unicode UTF-16 string can be coerced to a UTF-8 string.
      - A Unicode UTF-16 string can be coerced to either a single-byte string or a multi-byte string, as long as the
        character represented in the UTF-16 string exists in the local character set implied by the II_CHARSETxx
        setting.
  - question: What is the extent of Unicode support in Ingres and OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Ingres and OpenROAD support the Unicode Basic Multi-Lingual Plane with the exception of the Unicode Surrogate
      range. A Unicode Surrogate pair is treated as two independent Unicode code points.
  - question: Where can one find information about Unicode Normalization Forms in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Details about Unicode Normalization Forms can be found at http://www.unicode.org.
  - question: Where can one find information about character transliteration in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Information about character transliteration with SessionObject.GetEnv method can be found in the GetEnv Method
      documentation.
  - question: How does the II_CHARSETxx variable affect string encoding in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, the II_CHARSETxx variable determines how char and varchar strings are encoded. If II_CHARSETxx is
      set to UTF8, these strings are encoded as UTF-8 strings.
  - question: What types of encoded strings represent Unicode data in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, both UTF-8 encoded strings and UTF-16 encoded strings represent Unicode data.
