  - question: What is a simple variable in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      A simple variable in OpenROAD is a single data item that contains only one value. It can be any of the basic
      data types, such as integer or varchar, with the exception of table_key and object_key.
  - question: How do you declare a simple variable in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The syntax for declaring a simple variable in OpenROAD is:
      name = datatype [with null|not null] [not default|with default|[with] default defaultvalue]
      For example: i = integer;
  - question: Are simple variables nullable by default in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Yes, by default, all simple variables in OpenROAD are nullable. If you don't want the variable to be nullable,
      you must include the 'not null' clause in the declaration, for example: i = integer not null;
  - question: What are the default values for numeric and character simple variables in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      By default, all numeric simple variables are assigned a default value of zero, and all character simple
      variables are assigned a default value of the empty string ('').
  - question: How can you specify a different default value for a simple variable in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      To specify a different default value, you must include the default clause in the variable declaration. The
      default value must be null, a literal, or one of the system constants defined in the Language Reference Guide.
      For example: i = integer not null default false;
  - question: How do you use a simple variable in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      To use a simple variable in OpenROAD, you simply use the variable name. For example, to assign the value
      'Smith' to the person variable, you would use the following statement: person = 'Smith';
  - question: Can simple variables be elements of reference variables or arrays in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Yes, individual elements in a reference variable or an array can be simple variables in OpenROAD. For example,
      in a reference variable 'Film' with three attributes, each of these attributes is a simple variable. Similarly,
      in an array 'Movies', each individual element in the array is a simple variable.
  - question: How can you use simple variables as elements of reference variables or arrays in a 4GL script?
    answer: |
      In a 4GL script, you can use simple variables as reference or array variable elements in any context that you
      can use other simple variables. For example:
      film.Director = 'Hitchcock';
      if movies[].Title = 'ANNIE HALL' then ...
  - question: What are some clauses in simple variable declaration that are provided for SQL compatibility?
    answer: |
      The 'with null', 'not default', and 'with default' (without a value) clauses are provided for syntactic
      compatibility with SQL, but they have no effect in OpenROAD.
  - question: Where can you find information about referencing individual elements in reference or array variables?
    answer: |
      Information about referencing the individual elements in a reference or array variable can be found in the
      sections on Reference Variables and Dynamic Array Variables in the OpenROAD documentation.
