  - question: What is a dynamic array variable in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      A dynamic array variable in OpenROAD is a named set of rows. All the rows in the array are reference variables
      that point to objects of a given class (or any of its subclasses). The array is called dynamic because you can
      add or subtract rows, and the array automatically adjusts.
  - question: How are rows numbered in a dynamic array?
    answer: |
      Rows in a dynamic array are numbered. Some arrays may have rows with non-positive numbers, which are marked as
      "deleted". These deleted rows are not visible when the array is displayed in a table field, but they are not yet
      actually removed from the array.
  - question: What is an ArrayObject in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, each array is associated with an array object, which is an object of the class ArrayObject. The
      methods used to manipulate arrays are defined for this class, as described in the ArrayObject Class documentation.
  - question: How do you declare a dynamic array variable in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      To declare a dynamic array variable in OpenROAD, you specify any system class or user class for the objects
      associated with the variable. The syntax is:
      name = array of class [with] default null]
      For example: emparray = array of Emp;
  - question: Are dynamic arrays automatically populated when declared?
    answer: |
      No, when you declare a dynamic array in OpenROAD, it is empty. OpenROAD does not populate the array automatically.
      There are various methods you can use to add rows to an array, which are described in the Programming Guide.
  - question: How can you reference a dynamic array as a whole unit?
    answer: |
      To reference a dynamic array as a whole unit in OpenROAD, you simply use the array name. For example, if 'movies'
      is the name of an array, you can pass it to a frame like this:
      callframe movie_list (mv_fld = movies);
  - question: How do you reference an individual row in a dynamic array?
    answer: |
      To reference an individual row in a dynamic array, use the syntax: arrayname[n]
      where arrayname is the name of the array and n is the number of the row. For example:
      callproc update_row (mv_row = movies[i]);
  - question: What is the syntax for referencing a column in a dynamic array?
    answer: |
      To reference a column in a dynamic array, use the syntax: arrayname[*].columnname
      where arrayname is the name of the array and columnname is the name of the column. This is often used for
      detecting events on the column when the array is displayed in a table field.
  - question: How do you reference an individual element of a dynamic array?
    answer: |
      To reference an individual element of a dynamic array, use the syntax: arrayname[n].columnname
      where arrayname is the name of the array, n is the number of the row, and columnname is the name of the column.
  - question: Can dynamic arrays contain nested objects or arrays?
    answer: |
      Yes, dynamic arrays in OpenROAD can contain nested objects or arrays. An individual element of an array can be
      a reference variable or an array. You can reference elements of these nested objects or arrays in your 4GL code.
  - question: What is the syntax for referencing a nested object in a dynamic array?
    answer: |
      To reference a nested object in a dynamic array, use the syntax: arrayname[n].nestedobject.attribute
      where arrayname is the name of the object, n is the number of the row, nestedobject is the name of the nested
      object, and attribute is any attribute of that nested object.
  - question: What is the syntax for referencing a nested array in a dynamic array?
    answer: |
      To reference a nested array in a dynamic array, use the syntax: arrayname[n].nestedarrayname[x].attribute
      where arrayname is the name of the outer array, n is the row number in that array, nestedarrayname is the name
      of the nested array, x is the number of the row within the nested array, and attribute is any attribute of the
      nested array.
