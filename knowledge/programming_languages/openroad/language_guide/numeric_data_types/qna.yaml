  - question: What are the two main categories of numeric data types in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The two main categories of numeric data types in OpenROAD are:
      1. Exact numeric data types
      2. Approximate numeric data types
  - question: What are the integer data types available in OpenROAD and their ranges?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD provides the following integer data types:
      1. integer1 (tinyint): One-byte integer, range -128 to +127
      2. smallint (integer2): Two-byte integer, range -32,768 to +32,767
      3. integer (integer4): Four-byte integer, range -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647
      4. integer8 (bigint): Eight-byte integer, range -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to +9,223,372,036,854,775,807
  - question: How is the decimal data type defined in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, the decimal data type is an exact numeric type defined by its precision (total number of digits)
      and scale (number of digits to the right of the decimal point). The syntax is decimal(p,s) where p is precision
      and s is scale. The minimum precision is 1, maximum precision is 39, and scale cannot exceed precision (can be 0).
  - question: What are the floating point data types in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD provides two types of floating point data:
      1. float4 (real): 4-byte floating point
      2. float (float8, double precision): 8-byte floating point
  - question: What is the precision of floating point numbers in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD:
      - 8-byte floating point numbers are rounded to 15 decimal digits
      - 4-byte floating point number precision is processor-dependent
  - question: How can you specify the precision of a float data type in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, you can use the optional syntax float(n) where n is binary precision (0-53):
      - 0 to 23: 4-byte float
      - 24 to 53: 8-byte float
  - question: What are some important considerations when using numeric data types in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Important considerations for numeric data types in OpenROAD include:
      1. Be cautious with data type conversions, especially with floating point numbers.
      2. Exact matches on floating point numbers are discouraged due to their approximate nature.
      3. Float and float4 are approximate numeric values, while integer and decimal are exact.
      4. The decimal data type is preferable for currency calculations where precision is crucial.
      5. Floating point numbers are stored in four or eight bytes, depending on the type and specified precision.
  - question: Why is the decimal data type suitable for storing currency data in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The decimal data type in OpenROAD is suitable for storing currency data where the required range or precision
      exceeds the money data type. It allows for exact representation of decimal fractions, which is crucial for
      financial calculations. However, it doesn't include a currency sign for display purposes.
  - question: What are the synonyms for the decimal data type in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, the synonyms for the decimal data type are 'dec' and 'numeric'.
  - question: How should one choose the appropriate numeric data type in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      When choosing a numeric data type in OpenROAD, consider your specific requirements for range, precision, and
      exactness of calculations. Use integer types for whole numbers, decimal for exact fractional numbers
      (especially for currency), and floating point types for approximate values where a larger range is needed.
