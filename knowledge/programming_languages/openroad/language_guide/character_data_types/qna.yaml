  - question: What are the three character data types in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The three character data types in OpenROAD are:
      1. char (fixed-length)
      2. varchar (variable-length)
      3. long varchar (variable-length)
  - question: What is the maximum length of a character column in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The maximum length of a character column in OpenROAD depends on the installation:
      - For a non-UTF-8 installation: 32,000 bytes
      - For a UTF-8 installation: 16,000 bytes
  - question: How are char strings padded in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, char strings are padded with blanks to the declared length.
  - question: How are leading and embedded blanks treated when comparing char strings in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, leading and embedded blanks are significant when comparing char strings. For example,
      'A B C' and 'ABC' are considered different.
  - question: Is length significant when comparing char strings in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      No, length is not significant when comparing char strings in OpenROAD. The shorter string is (logically)
      padded to the length of the longer. For example, 'ABC' and 'ABC ' are considered equal.
  - question: How are blanks treated in varchar data types in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, blanks are significant in the varchar data type, except when comparing with char data.
      For example, 'the store is closed' and 'thestoreisclosed' are not considered equal as varchar strings.
  - question: How are varchar strings of unequal length compared in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      When comparing varchar strings of unequal length in OpenROAD, the shorter string is padded with trailing
      blanks until it equals the length of the longer string.
  - question: How is the long varchar data type supported in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The intrinsic Ingres DBMS long varchar data type is supported in OpenROAD through the LongVarcharObject
      system class.
  - question: Can varchar data types in OpenROAD contain non-printing characters?
    answer: |
      Yes, varchar data types in OpenROAD can contain any character, including non-printing characters and the
      ASCII null character ('\0').
  - question: How does OpenROAD compare varchar strings with different ASCII characters?
    answer: |
      When comparing varchar strings with different ASCII characters in OpenROAD, it considers the ASCII values.
      For example, 'abcd' > 'abcd\001' because the blank character added to 'abcd' to make the strings the same
      length has a higher value than ControlA ('\040' is greater than '\001').
