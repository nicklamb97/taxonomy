  - question: What does a null represent in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, a null represents an undefined or unknown value. It is specified by the keyword null.
  - question: Is a null the same as zero, a blank, or an empty string in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      No, in OpenROAD, a null is not the same as a zero, a blank, or an empty string.
  - question: How can you assign a null to a nullable variable in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      You can assign a null to any nullable variable in OpenROAD by using the null constant. For example:
      age = null;
  - question: What is the correct way to check if a variable is null in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The correct way to check if a variable is null in OpenROAD is to use the 'is null' operator. For example:
      if x is null ...
      You should not use: if x = null ...
  - question: What happens if you set a reference variable to null in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      If you set a reference variable to null in OpenROAD, the reference variable is no longer associated with an
      object. OpenROAD frees any object that does not have at least one reference variable pointing at it.
  - question: What are some ways to handle nulls in expressions in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, you can handle nulls in expressions using:
      1. The ifnull() function
      2. The is [not] null operator
  - question: Can nulls be assigned to non-nullable variables in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      No, nulls can only be assigned to nullable variables in OpenROAD.
  - question: What is the purpose of the 'is null' operator in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The 'is null' operator in OpenROAD is used to check if a variable is null. It's the correct way to perform
      null checks, as opposed to using equality comparison (=).
  - question: What is the difference between 'is null' and 'is not null' operators in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD:
      - 'is null' checks if a variable is null
      - 'is not null' checks if a variable is not null
      These operators provide a way to handle both cases when dealing with potentially null values.
  - question: Where can you find more information about the 'is null' operator in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      For more information about the 'is null' operator in OpenROAD, you can refer to the documentation section on
      the Is [Not] Null Operator.
