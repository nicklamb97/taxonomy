  - question: What are the main categories of data types in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The main categories of data types in OpenROAD are:
      1. Character Types
      2. Numeric Types
      3. Date and Time Types
      4. Other Types (such as money and boolean)
  - question: What are the character data types supported in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The character data types supported in OpenROAD are:
      1. char / character
      2. varchar / character varying
      3. long varchar / clob / character large object / char large object
      4. nchar / nvarchar
  - question: What are the numeric data types supported in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The numeric data types supported in OpenROAD are:
      1. integer / integer4
      2. smallint / integer2
      3. bigint / integer8
      4. decimal
      5. float / float8 / double precision
  - question: What date and time data types are supported in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD supports the following date and time data types:
      1. date
      2. timestamp (including with/without time zone), though it's not an intrinsic data type
  - question: What other data types are supported in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Other data types supported in OpenROAD include:
      1. money
      2. boolean (though not as an intrinsic data type)
  - question: Are all data types in OpenROAD nullable by default?
    answer: |
      Yes, by default, all data types in OpenROAD are nullable. However, you can use the `not null` clause to
      declare a data type non-nullable. It's important to note that a class data type is always nullable.
  - question: What is the OpenROAD Built-in Scalar Object for the varchar data type?
    answer: |
      The OpenROAD Built-in Scalar Object for the varchar data type is StringObject.
  - question: Does OpenROAD support the boolean data type as an intrinsic type?
    answer: |
      No, OpenROAD does not support the boolean data type as an intrinsic data type. However, it does support
      server-side coercion for boolean types.
  - question: What is the note regarding nchar and nvarchar data types in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD's transparent Unicode support negates the need for nchar and nvarchar data types in OpenROAD 4GL
      applications. The varchar data type with UTF8 encoding is sufficient for Unicode support.
  - question: What should be consulted for more detailed information about specific data types in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      For more detailed information about specific data types, including length and storage formats, you should
      refer to the Storage Formats of Data Types documentation. If using Enterprise Access, you should consult
      the Enterprise Access documentation for data type specifics.
