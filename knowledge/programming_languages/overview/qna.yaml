  - question: What is OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD is a database-centric, object-oriented, 4GL application development tool that enables the development
      and deployment business applications in various environments.
  - question: What are the principal features of OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The principal features of OpenROAD include:
      - OpenROAD Development: A complete integrated development environment (IDE) for building, testing, and deploying
      database applications.
      - OpenROAD Server: A robust, high-performance, distributed application development platform for deploying business
      objects.
      - OpenROAD Deployment: Enables deployment of applications to desktop web browsers, web servers, and mobile
      devices.
  - question: What types of applications can be developed using OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD allows the development of robust, scalable client/server and n-tier applications that can access
      various databases such as Ingres, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and DB2 UDB.
  - question: What is the programming language used in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD uses 4GL, an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that allows developers to create and reuse
      objects across applications and platforms.
  - question: What platforms does OpenROAD support?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD supports multiple platforms, including Windows, UNIX, and Linux. Applications built using OpenROAD
      are independent of the hardware and software platforms on which they are developed.
  - question: What is the concept of "write once, run everywhere" in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD's cross-platform support is provided at the binary level. Application images can be moved to any
      platform where the OpenROAD VM is supported, and the application will run identically on each platform without
      the need for testing or alterations.
  - question: What databases can be accessed using OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD provides high-performance open database access to the following databases:
      - Ingres and Enterprise Access products (Oracle, DB2 UDB, and Microsoft SQL Server) for development and
      runtime access.
      - EDBC products (Datacom, IDMS, DB2, IMS, and CICS/VSAM) for runtime access.
  - question: How does OpenROAD leverage Enterprise Access and EDBC?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD leverages the capabilities of Enterprise Access and Enterprise Database Connectivity (EDBC) to
      provide seamless access to data from desktop, server, mainframe, or network sources.
  - question: What is the purpose of Enterprise Access in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Enterprise Access is a middleware solution that provides organizations with the flexibility and integration
      to access information resources from a wide array of platforms and data sources. It enables OpenROAD to offer
      solutions for full, transparent read/write access to all existing data without changing its location or structure.
  - question: What is the significance of 4GL in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      4GL is a key part of the OpenROAD development environment. It is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language
      that allows developers to create and reuse objects across applications and platforms.
  - question: What are the object-oriented features supported by OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD supports object-oriented features such as inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
      These features enable developers to reuse components and maximize productivity.
  - question: How does OpenROAD simplify the task of designing enterprise applications?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD includes predefined system classes with methods and attributes that simplify the task of designing
      enterprise applications. These classes provide access to native Windows controls such as tab folders, tree views,
      and list views.
  - question: Can developers define their own classes in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Yes, developers can define their own user classes in OpenROAD. User-defined classes exhibit the same
      object-oriented features as system classes, enabling component reuse and productivity.
  - question: What are dynamic applications in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Dynamic applications in OpenROAD are applications that shape themselves based on actions initiated by
      the application, data values, or the end user. They are also scalable, responding dynamically to variations
      in data type complexity and database size.
  - question: How does OpenROAD enable the development of dynamic applications?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD's visual development environment allows developers to build different functionality into an
      application based on the end user or the mode the end user is operating in. Fields, menu items, and
      frames have specified biases and modes that determine their availability and behavior.
  - question: What is the benefit of OpenROAD's dynamic application development?
    answer: |
      The dynamic nature of OpenROAD applications increases end-user productivity and reduces the burden of coding
      for the application development team. Developers can specify details once and let OpenROAD generate
      the application.
  - question: What is the role of the Getting Started guide in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The Getting Started guide is an introduction to OpenROAD that provides what developers need to know for
      a quick and productive start. It offers an overview of OpenROAD and its features and walks through simple
      exercises in developing a variety of applications.
  - question: How does OpenROAD enable the migration and modernization of ABF applications?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD is a natural environment to migrate and modernize proven business logic from character-mode
      applications built using ABF (Application By Forms). Actian can accelerate this transformation with custom
      services that convert ABF applications to OpenROAD.
  - question: What is the purpose of the OpenROAD Server?
    answer: |
      The OpenROAD Server provides a robust, high-performance, distributed application development platform. Business
      objects developed in OpenROAD 4GL are deployed in the OpenROAD Server to provide services for a wide range of
      client technologies across the Internet.
  - question: How does OpenROAD support the deployment of applications?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD enables applications to be delivered to a desktop or placed on a web server for deployment when clients
      access them from a web browser, installing them automatically if not already installed. The runtime for Windows
      Mobile allows OpenROAD applications to be deployed to mobile phones and Pocket PC devices.
