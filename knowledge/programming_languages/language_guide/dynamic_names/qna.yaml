  - question: What is a dynamic name in OpenROAD?
    answer: A dynamic name in OpenROAD is a name that can be used in a statement either dynamically (when you run the
      application) or statically (when you create the application). Examples include table names and column names.
  - question: How are dynamic names represented in OpenROAD syntax examples?
    answer: In OpenROAD syntax examples, dynamic names are underlined to distinguish them from other elements.
  - question: Can you provide an example of a statement using dynamic names in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Here's an example of an SQL statement using dynamic names for table and column names:
      ```sql
      update tablename set columnname = expression {, columnname = expression} where current of cursor_variable
      ```
      In this example, 'tablename' and 'columnname' are dynamic names.
  - question: What are the main rules for using dynamic names in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The main rules for using dynamic names in OpenROAD are:
      - The variable used as a dynamic name can be a global variable or any variable in the current frame or procedure.
      - A dereferencing colon (:) must be placed before the dynamic name to differentiate it from an alphanumeric
        identifier.
      - If the variable is part of an object, put the colon before the full name.
      - In SQL statements, the colon is required before variable names.
      - Nullable variables can be used as dynamic names, but they cannot contain a null when used in SQL or 4GL
        statements.
      - For statically-specified dynamic names, do not use quotation marks unless the name is identical to an OpenROAD
        word.
      - For dynamically-specified dynamic names, use a varchar variable.
  - question: How do you differentiate between a variable used as a dynamic name and an alphanumeric identifier?
    answer: To differentiate between a variable used as a dynamic name and an alphanumeric identifier, put a
      dereferencing colon (:) before the dynamic name. This colon indicates that you are using the contents of a
      variable to supply the value for an OpenROAD name.
  - question: How should you use the dereferencing colon with object variables?
    answer: |
      When using the dereferencing colon with object variables, put the colon before the full name. For example:
      ```
      callframe :framearray.name;
      ```
      Do not place the colon in the middle of the name, like this:
      ```
      callframe framearray.:name;
      ```
  - question: Why is the colon required in SQL statements when using variables?
    answer: |
      In SQL statements, the colon is required before variable names to distinguish between variable names and
      column names. For example:
      ```sql
      select from tbl where col1 = :value;
      ```
      Placing the colon before "value" makes the select compare the col1 column with the value of the variable 'value'.
      Without the colon, the select would compare the col1 column with a column named "value".
  - question: Can nullable variables be used as dynamic names?
    answer: Although nullable variables can be used as dynamic names, they cannot contain a null when used in an SQL
      statement or a 4GL statement because it would cause a runtime error. If a null is used, the value will be
      replaced with zero for numbers or "$NULL$ERROR" for character strings, which may cause a runtime error.
  - question: How should statically-specified dynamic names be handled?
    answer: When using statically-specified dynamic names, do not put quotation marks around the name unless the name
      is identical to an OpenROAD word. For more information on OpenROAD words, refer to the 4GL Keywords
      documentation.
  - question: What type of variable should be used for dynamically-specified dynamic names?
    answer: When using dynamically-specified dynamic names, you should specify a varchar variable. At runtime,
      OpenROAD will substitute the current value of the variable for the name.
  - question: What is the advantage of using dynamically-specified dynamic names?
    answer: The advantage of using dynamically-specified dynamic names is that the values can be substituted at
      runtime. This behavior allows processing to be guided by user input or other runtime conditions, providing more
      flexibility in application design.
  - question: How does OpenROAD handle runtime errors with dynamic names containing nulls?
    answer: If a dynamic name variable contains a null when used in an SQL or 4GL statement, OpenROAD will attempt to
      execute the statement but will replace the null value. For numbers, it will use zero, and for character strings,
      it will use "$NULL$ERROR". This substitution may lead to a runtime error, depending on the context of the
      statement.
  - question: Can you use dynamic names in all parts of an OpenROAD application?
    answer: Dynamic names can be used in various parts of an OpenROAD application, including SQL statements, 4GL
      statements, and when referencing objects, frames, and procedures. However, it's important to follow the rules
      and best practices for their usage to avoid runtime errors.
  - question: How do dynamic names contribute to the flexibility of OpenROAD applications?
    answer: Dynamic names contribute to the flexibility of OpenROAD applications by allowing developers to create more
      adaptable and responsive programs. They enable the use of variable names for tables, columns, objects, and other
      elements, which can be determined at runtime based on user input, application state, or other factors. This
      capability supports the creation of more dynamic and customizable applications.
  - question: What are some best practices for using dynamic names in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Some best practices for using dynamic names in OpenROAD include:
      - Always use the dereferencing colon (:) correctly to avoid confusion between variables and identifiers.
      - Validate the content of dynamic name variables before use to prevent runtime errors.
      - Use clear and descriptive variable names for dynamic names to improve code readability.
      - Document the use of dynamic names in your code to help other developers understand their purpose and behavior.
      - Be cautious when using dynamic names with user input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
  - question: How can dynamic names be used to create more generic and reusable code in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Dynamic names can be used to create more generic and reusable code in OpenROAD by:
      - Creating functions or procedures that can work with different tables or columns based on input parameters.
      - Implementing dynamic SQL queries that can adapt to different data structures or user requirements.
      - Building flexible user interfaces that can display different data fields based on user roles or preferences.
      - Developing modular components that can be easily customized for different applications or clients.
  - question: What are some potential pitfalls to avoid when using dynamic names in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Some potential pitfalls to avoid when using dynamic names in OpenROAD include:
      - Forgetting to use the dereferencing colon, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
      - Using dynamic names with unvalidated user input, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
      - Overusing dynamic names, which can make code harder to read, maintain, and debug.
      - Not handling potential null values properly, which can cause runtime errors.
      - Failing to consider performance implications when using dynamic names extensively in SQL queries.
  - question: How does the use of dynamic names impact application performance in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The use of dynamic names can impact application performance in OpenROAD in several ways:
      - Dynamic SQL statements using dynamic names cannot be precompiled, which may lead to slightly slower execution
        times.
      - Excessive use of dynamic names can increase the complexity of queries, potentially affecting query optimization.
      - Runtime resolution of dynamic names adds a small overhead to execution time.
      - However, the flexibility provided by dynamic names can often outweigh these performance considerations,
        especially in scenarios where adaptability is crucial.
  - question: Can dynamic names be used with stored procedures in OpenROAD?
    answer: Yes, dynamic names can be used with stored procedures in OpenROAD. This allows for the creation of more
      flexible and reusable stored procedures. However, care must be taken to ensure that the dynamic names are
      properly validated and that the stored procedure is designed to handle different table or column names safely.
  - question: How do dynamic names interact with OpenROAD's object-oriented features?
    answer: |
      Dynamic names in OpenROAD can interact with object-oriented features in several ways:
      - They can be used to dynamically call methods or access properties of objects.
      - Dynamic names can be employed to create more flexible class hierarchies and polymorphic behavior.
      - They allow for the creation of generic object factories or builders that can instantiate different types of
        objects based on runtime conditions.
      - However, excessive use of dynamic names with object-oriented code can potentially make the code harder to
        understand and maintain, so a balance should be struck between flexibility and clarity.
