seed_examples:
  - question: How can simple variables be used in expressions in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Simple variables in OpenROAD can be used alone or in expressions. For example:
      age = age + 1;
      OpenROAD uses the current value of the variable to compute a new value that replaces the current value.
  - question: How can procedures be used in expressions in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      When a procedure returns a value in OpenROAD, it can function as an expression. For example:
      returnval = procname() + 1;
      When calling a procedure in an expression, don't use the callproc keyword, include parentheses even if not 
      passing parameters, and explicitly name the procedure.
  - question: What are the rules for calling a procedure as part of an expression in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The rules for calling a procedure as part of an expression in OpenROAD are:
      1. Do not use the callproc keyword.
      2. Include the parentheses even if you are not passing any parameters to the procedure.
      3. Explicitly name the procedure.
  - question: How can methods be used in expressions in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Methods can be used in expressions in OpenROAD when they return a value. For example:
      returnval = objectref.methodname() + 1;
      When calling a method in an expression, you must explicitly name the method.
  - question: How are nulls handled in expressions in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD:
      - Nulls can only be tested using the 'is null' or 'is not null' operators.
      - If any item (other than a reference variable) in an expression has a null value, the value of the entire 
        expression is null.
      - If any simple variable in a comparison is null, the result of the comparison is null.
  - question: How can expressions be used in SQL statements in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, expressions in SQL statements can use:
      - Literals or database column names as operands
      - Named constants or simple variable names (preceded by a colon) to replace literals
      - SQL functions and operators (evaluated by the database)
      Expressions can specify values to be retrieved (in SELECT clauses) or compared (in WHERE clauses).
  - question: Can the field function be used in database statements in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      No, the field function is not allowed in database statements in OpenROAD. Also, procedure or method 
      invocations are not allowed in database statements.
  - question: Where can expressions containing aggregate functions appear in SQL statements in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, expressions that contain aggregate functions can appear only in SELECT and HAVING clauses of 
      SQL statements. Additionally, aggregate functions cannot be nested.
  - question: How does OpenROAD handle an expression enclosed in parentheses?
    answer: |
      In OpenROAD, an expression can be enclosed in parentheses without affecting its value.
  - question: Can you use a variable for the name of a method in an expression in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Yes, you can use a variable for the name of a method in an expression in OpenROAD if you assign the name to 
      a varchar variable. For example: a = objectref.:varmeth();
      However, you cannot use operators when assigning a variable as the method name.
