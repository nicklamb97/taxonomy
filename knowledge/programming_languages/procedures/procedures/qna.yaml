  - question: What is a procedure in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      A procedure is a named piece of code that performs a single task. Procedures process in sequence and are not associated with a form, making them useful for eliminating duplication among scripts and enhancing code readability.

  - question: How can procedures be defined in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Procedures can be defined in two ways:
      - Globally: Accessible from any OpenROAD script within the application or from a second application if included.
      - Locally: Accessible only from the script in which they are defined or from descendent fields within the scope of the calling script.

  - question: What are the types of procedures available in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD supports three types of procedures:
      - 4GL procedures
      - Database procedures
      - 3GL procedures

  - question: How are global 4GL procedures created?
    answer: |
      Global 4GL procedures are created in the OpenROAD Workbench.

  - question: How are local 4GL procedures declared and defined?
    answer: |
      Local 4GL procedures are declared and defined in the frame, field, or procedure script in which they are called.

  - question: What is the purpose of database procedures in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Database procedures are created and maintained independently of OpenROAD but must be registered with specific applications. They are available outside of OpenROAD applications.

  - question: How are 3GL procedures integrated with OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      3GL procedures are created and maintained independently of OpenROAD but must be registered with specific applications to be accessible.

  - question: Can you provide an example of when to use a procedure in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Procedures are used to eliminate duplication among scripts and make code more readable. For example, a common calculation performed in multiple scripts can be placed in a procedure and called whenever needed.

  - question: What is the difference between event-driven code and procedures in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Unlike event-driven code that is triggered by events in frame and field scripts, procedures process in a sequential manner.

  - question: Can a procedure access 3GL languages from an OpenROAD script?
    answer: |
      Yes, procedures provide the means of accessing a 3GL language from an OpenROAD script.
