  - question: What is a database procedure in OpenROAD?
    answer: >
      A database procedure is a data-oriented procedure stored in the database
      and executed within the database server. You can call it by name in a
      script or 4GL procedure. Database procedures are used to increase
      performance and help ensure data integrity and consistency.
  - question: How do you use a database procedure in an OpenROAD application?
    answer: >
      To use a database procedure in an OpenROAD application, you need to create
      the procedure using the Database Procedure Editor and then register it
      with the OpenROAD Workbench. For more details on registering a database
      procedure, refer to the *Workbench User Guide*.
  - question: >-
      Where can I find more information about calling database procedures in
