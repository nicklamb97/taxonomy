  - question: What is a database procedure in OpenROAD?
    answer: >
      A database procedure is a data-oriented procedure stored in the database
      and executed within the database server. You can call it by name in a
      script or 4GL procedure. Database procedures are used to increase
      performance and help ensure data integrity and consistency.
  - question: How do you use a database procedure in an OpenROAD application?
    answer: >
      To use a database procedure in an OpenROAD application, you need to create
      the procedure using the Database Procedure Editor and then register it
      with the OpenROAD Workbench. For more details on registering a database
      procedure, refer to the *Workbench User Guide*.
  - question: >-
      Where can I find more information about calling database procedures in
      OpenROAD?
    answer: >
      For more information about calling database procedures in OpenROAD, see
      the section on Calling Procedures in the OpenROAD documentation.
  - question: What is the benefit of using database procedures in OpenROAD?
    answer: >
      Using database procedures in OpenROAD helps to increase performance by
      executing complex operations within the database server. They also help
      ensure data integrity and consistency by centralizing business logic
      within the database.
  - question: Can you call a database procedure from a 4GL script in OpenROAD?
    answer: >
      Yes, you can call a database procedure from a 4GL script in OpenROAD.
      Database procedures are executed within the database server, and you can
      invoke them by name from within your 4GL scripts or procedures.
  - question: What tool is used to create database procedures in OpenROAD?
    answer: >
      Database procedures in OpenROAD are created using the Database Procedure
      Editor. After creating the procedure, it must be registered with the
      OpenROAD Workbench to be used in the application.
  - question: How does using database procedures affect application performance?
    answer: >
      Using database procedures can significantly improve application
      performance by offloading complex processing to the database server. This
      reduces the amount of data transferred between the application and the
      database and leverages the database server's optimized processing
      capabilities.
