  - question: What is the purpose of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement?
    answer: An Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement repeats a series of statements, incrementing
      or decrementing an index variable.
  - question: What is the basic syntax of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement?
    answer: 'The basic syntax is: [label:] for indexvariable = startexpression to|downto
      endexpression do statementlist endfor;'
  - question: How does the 'to' and 'downto' keywords affect the Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      For Statement?
    answer: In an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement, 'to' causes the index variable
      to increment, while 'downto' causes it to decrement.
  - question: What are the ways to break out of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For loop?
    answer: You can break out of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For loop using the endloop,
      continue, resume, or return statements.
  - question: How does the 'endloop' statement work in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement?
    answer: The 'endloop' statement in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement closes the
      loop immediately and continues execution with the first statement following the
      endfor statement.
  - question: What is the purpose of labels in nested Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statements?
    answer: Labels in nested Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statements allow control over breaking
      out of specific levels of nested loops using endloop or continue statements.
  - question: How does the 'continue' statement affect an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For loop?
    answer: The 'continue' statement in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For loop skips the remaining
      statements in the current iteration, adjusts the index variable, and begins the
      next iteration.
  - question: What happens to the index variable after an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For loop
      exits?
    answer: The contents of the index variable upon exit from an Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      For loop are undefined.
  - question: How is the end condition evaluated in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement?
    answer: In an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement, the end condition is re-evaluated
      before each iteration, including the first one.
  - question: Can Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statements be nested?
    answer: Yes, Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statements can be nested, allowing for complex
      looping structures.
