  - question: What is the purpose of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Procedure Statement?
    answer: An Actian 4GL OpenROAD Procedure Statement defines a 4GL procedure, either
      global or local.
  - question: What is the basic syntax of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Procedure Statement?
    answer: 'The basic syntax is: procedure procname [(parameterlist)] = [declareblock]
      beginendblock[;]'
  - question: Can local procedures be defined within global procedures in Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD?
    answer: Yes, a global 4GL procedure can define local procedures, but a local procedure
      cannot define other procedures.
  - question: How should the procname be specified for a global procedure in Actian
      4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: For a global procedure, the procname must match the name specified when
      coding the procedure in OpenROAD Workbench.
  - question: How should the procname be specified for a local procedure in Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD?
    answer: For a local procedure, the procname must match the name specified in a declare
      block or initialize statement.
  - question: What is the purpose of the parameterlist in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Procedure
      Statement?
    answer: The parameterlist defines the parameters that the procedure accepts, following
      the NamedParameterListDefinition.
  - question: How does the declareblock differ for global and local procedures in Actian
      4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: For local procedures, it follows DeclareBlock; for global procedures, it
      follows DeclareBlockWithProcedures.
  - question: What is the purpose of the beginendblock in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Procedure
      Statement?
    answer: The beginendblock contains the actual code that defines the procedure's
      functionality.
  - question: Can you provide an example of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Procedure Statement
      that adds tax to an amount?
    answer: procedure addtax (tax = float, amount = money) = begin return amount + amount*tax;
      end
  - question: Is it possible to define an Actian 4GL OpenROAD procedure without parameters?
    answer: 'Yes, for example: procedure printmsg = begin message ''Here is a message'';
      end'
