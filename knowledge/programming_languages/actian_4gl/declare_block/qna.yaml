  - question: What is a DeclareBlock in programming?
    answer: |
      A DeclareBlock is used to declare local variables in a program.
  - question: What is the basic syntax of a DeclareBlock?
    answer: |
      The basic syntax of a DeclareBlock is:
      declare {localvariabledeclaration} [enddeclare]
  - question: Is the 'enddeclare' keyword mandatory in a DeclareBlock?
    answer: |
      No, the 'enddeclare' keyword is optional in a DeclareBlock, as indicated by the square brackets in the syntax.
  - question: What does the term 'localvariabledeclaration' refer to in the DeclareBlock syntax?
    answer: |
      The term 'localvariabledeclaration' refers to the declaration of local variables. For more details, one should
      refer to the LocalVariableDeclaration section.
  - question: Can multiple local variables be declared in a single DeclareBlock?
    answer: |
      Yes, multiple local variables can be declared in a single DeclareBlock. This is indicated by the curly braces
      {} around 'localvariabledeclaration' in the syntax, which suggest that multiple declarations are allowed.
  - question: What is the purpose of using a DeclareBlock?
    answer: |
      The purpose of using a DeclareBlock is to declare local variables, which are typically used within a specific
      scope or block of code.
  - question: How does a DeclareBlock differ from global variable declarations?
    answer: |
      A DeclareBlock is specifically used for local variables, which have a limited scope, usually within the block
      or function where they are declared. Global variables, on the other hand, have a broader scope and are
      accessible throughout the entire program.
  - question: Where can I find more information about how to declare local variables?
    answer: |
      For more information about how to declare local variables, you should refer to the LocalVariableDeclaration
      section of the documentation.
  - question: Is the 'declare' keyword required to start a DeclareBlock?
    answer: |
      Yes, the 'declare' keyword is required to start a DeclareBlock, as shown in the syntax.
  - question: Can you explain the structure of a DeclareBlock?
    answer: |
      A DeclareBlock starts with the 'declare' keyword, followed by one or more local variable declarations. It can
      optionally end with the 'enddeclare' keyword. The actual variable declarations are defined in the
      LocalVariableDeclaration section.
