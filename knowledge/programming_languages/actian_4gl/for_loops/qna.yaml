  - question: What is the purpose of a FOR loop in Actian 4GL for OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      A FOR loop in Actian 4GL is used for repetitive execution of a block of code for a specified number of iterations
      or through a sequence of values. It's an essential control structure for performing tasks multiple times.

  - question: What are the two main types of FOR loops in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The two main types of FOR loops in Actian 4GL are:
      1. Iterating over a range of values
      2. Iterating through a set of records (FOR EACH loop)

  - question: What is the basic syntax for a FOR loop iterating over a range in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The basic syntax for a FOR loop iterating over a range in Actian 4GL is:
      ```4gl
      FOR variable = start_value TO end_value [STEP step_value]
          statements
      END FOR
      ```

  - question: What is the basic syntax for a FOR EACH loop in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The basic syntax for a FOR EACH loop in Actian 4GL is:
      ```4gl
      FOR EACH record IN table
          statements
      END FOR
      ```

  - question: What is the purpose of the STEP clause in a FOR loop?
    answer: |
      The STEP clause in a FOR loop allows you to specify the increment for the control variable on each iteration.
      It's optional, and if not specified, the default step value is 1. It can be used to skip certain values or to
      decrement the control variable.

  - question: How does the control variable behave in a FOR loop iterating over a range?
    answer: |
      In a FOR loop iterating over a range, the control variable is initialized to the start_value and is incremented
      by the step_value (default is 1) on each iteration. The loop continues to execute until the control variable
      exceeds the end_value.

  - question: What is the purpose of a FOR EACH loop in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      A FOR EACH loop in Actian 4GL is specifically designed for iterating through records in a database table. It
      allows you to perform operations on each record within the specified table. The loop variable is assigned each
      record in the table sequentially.

  - question: What are nested FOR loops and when are they used?
    answer: |
      Nested FOR loops are loops within loops. They are used when you need to perform multi-level iterations, such as
      iterating over rows and columns in a grid or matrix. The inner loop completes all its iterations for each single
      iteration of the outer loop, providing a way to handle multi-dimensional data or complex sequences.

  - question: How does the FOR EACH loop assign records to the loop variable?
    answer: |
      In a FOR EACH loop, the loop variable (record) is assigned each record in the specified table sequentially.
      The block of code within the loop is executed for each record, allowing operations to be performed on each
      record in the table.

  - question: Can you use a negative step value in a FOR loop?
    answer: |
      Yes, you can use a negative step value in a FOR loop. This allows you to decrement the control variable on
      each iteration, which is useful when you want to iterate backwards through a range of values.
