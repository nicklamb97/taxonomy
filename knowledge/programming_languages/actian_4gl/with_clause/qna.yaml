  - question: What is the purpose of the Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause?
    answer: The Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause is used to override the called frame's
      original definition, specifying a list of attributes in the GhostExec or FrameExec
      definition.
  - question: What is the basic syntax of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause?
    answer: 'The basic syntax is: WITH attribute = expression{, attribute = expression}'
  - question: What does 'attribute' represent in the Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause?
    answer: '''attribute'' specifies any of the attributes that can be set for the GhostExec
      or FrameExec class, depending on the type of frame being called.'
  - question: How are expressions used in the Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause?
    answer: In the Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause, 'expression' specifies any legal
      expression that evaluates to the appropriate data type for the attribute being
      set.
  - question: What happens to attributes not explicitly set in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      With Clause?
    answer: Attributes not explicitly set in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause default
      to the values they have in the GhostExec or FrameExec object.
  - question: What is the scope of attributes set using the Actian 4GL OpenROAD With
      Clause?
    answer: Attributes set using the Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause are valid only
      for that specific instance of the frame.
  - question: Can multiple attributes be set in a single Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause?
    answer: Yes, multiple attributes can be set in a single Actian 4GL OpenROAD With
      Clause, separated by commas.
  - question: How does the Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause affect the original frame
      definition?
    answer: The Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause overrides the original frame definition
      for the specific instance, but does not permanently change the frame's attributes.
  - question: In what context is the Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause typically used?
    answer: The Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause is typically used when calling a frame
      and needing to modify its behavior or properties for that specific call.
  - question: How does the Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause contribute to code flexibility?
    answer: The Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause allows for dynamic modification of frame
      properties, enabling more flexible and context-specific behavior of frames in
      the application.
