  - question: What is a BeginEndBlock in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      A BeginEndBlock in OpenROAD Actian 4GL specifies statements surrounded by the `begin` and `end` keywords or
      alternatively delimited by curly braces (`{â€¦}`).
  - question: What are the two ways to delimit a BeginEndBlock?
    answer: |
      A BeginEndBlock can be delimited in two ways:
      1. Using the `begin` and `end` keywords
      2. Using curly braces `{` and `}`
  - question: What is the syntax of a BeginEndBlock?
    answer: |
      The syntax of a BeginEndBlock is:
      ```
      begin | {
          [statementlist]
      end | }
      ```
      Where `statementlist` represents the list of statements enclosed within the block.
  - question: Is the statementlist in a BeginEndBlock mandatory?
    answer: |
      No, the statementlist in a BeginEndBlock is optional. This is indicated by the square brackets `[]` in the
      syntax description.
  - question: Can you mix `begin` with `}` or `{` with `end` in a BeginEndBlock?
    answer: |
      No, you should not mix the keyword and brace styles. Use either `begin` with `end` or `{` with `}` to maintain
      consistency and readability in your code.
  - question: What is the purpose of a BeginEndBlock?
    answer: |
      A BeginEndBlock is used to group multiple statements together, creating a compound statement. This is useful
      for control structures, functions, and organizing code into logical blocks.
  - question: Are BeginEndBlocks in OpenROAD Actian 4GL similar to those in other programming languages?
    answer: |
      Yes, BeginEndBlocks in OpenROAD Actian 4GL are similar to block structures in many other programming languages.
      The concept of grouping statements is common across various languages, though the specific syntax may differ.
  - question: Can BeginEndBlocks be nested?
    answer: |
      While not explicitly stated in the given information, it's common in most programming languages to allow nesting
      of block structures. Therefore, it's likely that BeginEndBlocks in OpenROAD Actian 4GL can be nested.
  - question: How does using curly braces differ from using begin/end keywords?
    answer: |
      Functionally, there is no difference between using curly braces and begin/end keywords. The choice is a matter
      of coding style and preference. Some developers may prefer the more compact curly brace notation, while others
      may find the begin/end keywords more readable.
  - question: In what contexts might BeginEndBlocks be used in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      While not specified in the given information, BeginEndBlocks are typically used in various contexts such as:
      - Defining the body of functions or procedures
      - Grouping statements in control structures (if-else, loops, etc.)
      - Creating local scopes for variables
      - Organizing code into logical units
