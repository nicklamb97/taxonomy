  - question: What is the callframe statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The callframe statement in Actian 4GL opens a new frame in a new window and transfers control from
      the current frame to another frame. It is often used to display dialogs for user input relevant to
      the calling frame.
  - question: What is the syntax of the callframe statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the callframe statement in Actian 4GL is:
      ```4gl
      [returnvariable =] callframe framename([parameterlist])
                [withclause];
      ```
      - `returnvariable`: Optional. Variable in the calling frame to receive the return value.
      - `framename`: Name of the frame to be called. It can be a dynamic name.
      - `parameterlist`: Parameters passed to the called frame.
      - `withclause`: Additional options for frame placement and behavior.
  - question: How does the callframe statement handle frame name resolution?
    answer: |
      In Actian 4GL, framename can be an actual name or a variable resolved at runtime. Compile-time resolution
      is used for actual names, while runtime resolution applies to variables, allowing dynamic frame invocation.
  - question: Can callframe statements be nested?
    answer: |
      Yes, callframe statements can be nested, enabling called frames to further call other frames recursively,
      facilitating complex application flow and interaction.
  - question: What is the role of return statement with callframe?
    answer: |
      The return statement exits a called frame and passes a value back to the calling frame using returnvariable,
      ensuring compatibility of data types between the frame's return value and the receiving variable.
  - question: How are parameters passed in the callframe statement?
    answer: |
      Parameters in the callframe statement are passed using NamedParameterList syntax, allowing developers to
      specify parameter values by name or by reference for dynamic interaction between frames.
