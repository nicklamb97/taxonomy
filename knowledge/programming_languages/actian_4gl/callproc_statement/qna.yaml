  - question: What is the purpose of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement?
    answer: An Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement is used to call a procedure from
      a frame, a procedure, or a method for a user class.
  - question: What types of procedures can be called using the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc
      Statement?
    answer: The Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement can call global or local procedures
      written in 4GL, and procedures written in other high-level programming languages
      (3GL languages such as C or FORTRAN).
  - question: What is the basic syntax of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement?
    answer: 'The basic syntax is: [returnvariable =] callproc procname[(parameterlist)];'
  - question: How does the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement handle procedure name
      resolution?
    answer: If an actual procedure name is used, OpenROAD resolves the reference at
      compile time. If a variable is used, the procedure reference is resolved at runtime.
  - question: How can parameters be passed in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement?
    answer: Parameters can be passed by value or by reference. To pass values by reference,
      the byref(variable) option is used.
  - question: What is the importance of data type compatibility in Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      Callproc Statement?
    answer: The data type of the variable receiving the return value must be compatible
      with the return type of the called procedure. For database procedures, the return
      type is always integer.
  - question: Can the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement be used without the 'callproc'
      keyword?
    answer: Yes, when calling a procedure as part of an expression, the 'callproc' keyword
      is not needed.
  - question: What is the 'returnvariable' parameter in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc
      Statement?
    answer: The 'returnvariable' specifies the name of the variable in the calling frame
      or procedure that receives the return value from the called procedure.
  - question: How should procedure names that are the same as 4GL keywords be handled
      in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement?
    answer: Procedure names that are the same as 4GL keywords must be enclosed in single
      quotes.
  - question: What is the difference between using NamedParameterList and UnnamedParameterList
      in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement?
    answer: NamedParameterList is used for 4GL procedures, while UnnamedParameterList
      is used for 3GL procedures.
