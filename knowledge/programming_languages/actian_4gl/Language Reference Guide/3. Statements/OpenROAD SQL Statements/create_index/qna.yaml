  - question: What is the purpose of the create index statement?
    answer: |
      The create index statement in Ingres databases creates an index on an existing table to improve query processing
      by organizing the data in specified columns. Indexes can be unique or non-unique and use storage structures
      like BTREE, ISAM, HASH, or RTREE.
  - question: What is the syntax of the create index statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the create index statement is:
      ```
      create [unique] index [schema.]index_name
                on [schema.]table_name
                (column_name {, column_name})
                [with with_clause];
      ```
      Here, `index_name` specifies the name of the index, `table_name` is the table on which the index is created, and
      `column_name` lists the columns included in the index. Optional clauses like `with` can specify additional
      parameters such as storage structure (`structure`) and key columns (`key`).
  - question: What are the parameters available for the create index statement?
    answer: |
      The create index statement supports parameters such as `index_name`, `table_name`, `column_name`, `structure`,
      `with_clause`, and more. These parameters define the name, table, columns, storage structure, and additional
      settings for the index creation.
  - question: What permissions are required to execute the create index statement?
    answer: |
      To execute the create index statement, the user must be the owner of the table where the index is being created.
      Special permissions are required to create indexes on system tables or when using specific index options.
  - question: How does the create index statement affect database locking?
    answer: |
      Creating an index on a table requires an exclusive lock on the table, preventing other sessions from accessing
      the table until the index creation is complete. This ensures data integrity during the indexing process.
  - question: What are some related statements to the create index statement?
    answer: |
      Related statements include:
      - Modify Statement: Used to change index properties after creation.
      - Drop Statement: Used to delete an index from a table.
      - Create Table Statement: Used to create new tables where indexes can be applied.
