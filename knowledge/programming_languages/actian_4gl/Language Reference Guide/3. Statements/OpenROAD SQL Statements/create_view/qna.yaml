  - question: What is the syntax of the create view statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the create view statement in Ingres is as follows:
      ```
      create view view_name
                    [(column_name {, column_name})]
                    as select_stmt
                    [with check option];
      ```

  - question: What parameters can be used in the create view statement?
    answer: |
      Parameters for the create view statement in Ingres include:
      - view_name: Defines the name of the view, which must be a valid object name.
      - column_name: Specifies the name of a column in the view.
      - select_stmt: Specifies a select statement that defines the view's contents.
      - with check option: Optional clause that prevents inserts or updates
        violating the view's qualification.

  - question: How does the create view statement define a virtual table?
    answer: |
      The create view statement in Ingres uses a select statement to define
      the contents of a virtual table. The view definition is stored in the
      system catalogs. When the view is used in a statement, it operates on
      the underlying tables.

  - question: What are the restrictions on updates, inserts, and deletes for views in Ingres?
    answer: |
      Updates, inserts, and deletes on views in Ingres are subject to several
      restrictions:
      - The view must be based on a single updatable table or view.
      - All columns must directly map to columns in the base table or view
        (no aggregate functions or derived columns allowed).
      - The select statement must omit distinct, group by, union, and having
        clauses.
      - Inserts are not allowed if a mandatory (not null not default) column
        in a base table is omitted from the view.
      - Up to 1024 columns can be specified for a view.

  - question: What is the purpose of the with check option clause in the create view statement?
    answer: |
      The with check option clause prevents inserts or updates to a view that
      would create rows not compliant with the view's definition (specified in
      the where clause of the defining select statement).

  - question: What considerations should be taken for using create view in a distributed environment in Ingres?
    answer: |
      In a distributed environment with Ingres, the create view statement has
      additional considerations. For detailed information, refer to the Ingres
      Star User Guide.

  - question: What permissions are required to execute select statements that define a view?
    answer: |
      To execute select statements that define a view in Ingres, you must have
      all privileges required to access the underlying base tables of the view.
