  - question: What is the purpose of the create group statement?
    answer: |
      The create group statement in Ingres databases establishes a group identifier and associates it with a specified
      list of users. This allows the database administrator or a user with the necessary security privileges to grant
      identical privileges to a group of users.
  - question: What is the syntax of the create group statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the create group statement is:
      ```
      create group group_id [, group_id]
              [with users = (user_id [, user_id])];
      ```
      Here, `group_id` is the identifier for the group, which must be a valid object name unique among all user,
      group, and role identifiers. The optional `with users` clause specifies the initial list of users to be included
      in the group.
  - question: What permissions are required to execute the create group statement?
    answer: |
      To execute the create group statement, the user must have the MAINTAIN_USERS privilege and be connected to the
      iidbdb database, where group information is stored.
  - question: How does the create group statement affect database locking?
    answer: |
      The create group statement locks pages in the iiusergroup catalog in the iidbdb database. Sessions attempting
      to connect to the server during this process may be suspended until the statement completes.
  - question: What are the related statements to the create group statement?
    answer: |
      The create group statement is related to:
      - Alter Group Statement: Used to modify an existing group identifier, such as adding or removing users.
      - Drop Group Statement: Used to delete a group identifier and remove associated users from the system.
