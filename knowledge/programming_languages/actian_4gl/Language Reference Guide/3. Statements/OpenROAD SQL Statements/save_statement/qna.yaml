- question: What is the purpose of the save statement in Actian 4GL SQL?
  answer: |
    The save statement directs the DBMS Server to save the specified table until a given expiration date. This allows you to set a future date after which the table may be purged from the database.

- question: What is the syntax of the save statement?
  answer: |
    The syntax of the save statement is:
    
    save [schema.]table_name [until month day year];

    Where schema is optional, table_name is the name of the table to be saved, and the until clause is optional for specifying an expiration date.

- question: What happens if you omit the 'until' clause in the save statement?
  answer: |
    If the until clause is omitted, the expiration date is set to "no expiration date". This means the table will be saved indefinitely.

- question: What is the valid date range for the expiration date in the save statement?
  answer: |
    The range of valid dates is from January 1, 1970 through December 31, 2035, inclusive.

- question: How should the date be specified in the save statement?
  answer: |
    The date should be specified as follows:
    - month: Must be an integer from 1 through 12, or the name of the month (abbreviated or spelled out)
    - day: Must be a valid day of the month (1 to 31)
    - year: Must be a fully specified year, for example, 2012

- question: Can you assign an expiration date to a system table using the save statement?
  answer: |
    No, an expiration date cannot be assigned to a system table using the save statement.

- question: What permissions are required to use the save statement?
  answer: |
    You must own the table to use the save statement on it.

- question: What kind of lock does the save statement take on the specified table?
  answer: |
    The save statement takes an exclusive lock on the specified table.

- question: Are expired tables automatically purged from the database?
  answer: |
    No, expired tables are not automatically purged. To purge expired tables from the database, you need to use the verifydb command.

- question: Can you provide an example of using the save statement?
  answer: |
    Here's an example of using the save statement:

    save employee until feb 27 2011;

    This statement saves the employee table until February 27, 2011.
