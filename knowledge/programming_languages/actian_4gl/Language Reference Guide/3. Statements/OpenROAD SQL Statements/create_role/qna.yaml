  - question: What is the purpose of the create role statement?
    answer: |
      The create role statement defines one or more role identifiers and their associated password. Role identifiers
      are used to associate privileges with applications and can be used with the connect statement to associate
      those privileges with the session.
  - question: Who can use a role after it is created?
    answer: |
      Only users who have been granted access to a role can use it. The creator of a role is automatically granted
      access to that role.
  - question: What is the syntax for the create role statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax for the create role statement is:
      ```
      create role role_id {, role_id}
                [with with_option {, with_option}];
      ```
  - question: What is the role_id parameter?
    answer: |
      The role_id parameter specifies the user name to be created. It must be a valid object name that is unique
      among all role, group, and user identifier names in the installation. If an invalid role identifier is specified,
      the DBMS Server returns an error but processes all valid role identifiers.
  - question: What is stored in the iirole catalog of the iidbdb?
    answer: |
      Role identifiers are stored in the iirole catalog of the iidbdb.
  - question: What are the possible values for the with_option parameter?
    answer: |
      The with_option parameter can specify one of the following password options:
      - nopassword
      - password = 'role_password'
      - role_password
  - question: What is the role_password option?
    answer: |
      The role_password option allows a user to change his password. Users with the MAINTAIN_USERS privilege can
      change or remove any password. If role_password contains uppercase or special characters, it should be
      enclosed in single quotes. Any blanks in the password are removed when it is stored.
  - question: What is the limit on the role_password length?
    answer: |
      The role_password can be no longer than 24 characters.
  - question: What permissions are required to create a role?
    answer: |
      You must have maintain_users privilege and be connected to the iidbdb database. To change security audit
      attributes, you must have maintain_audit privilege.
  - question: What happens when the create role statement is executed?
    answer: |
      The create role statement locks pages in the iirole catalog of the iidbdb, which can cause sessions attempting
      to connect to the server to suspend until the statement is completed.
  - question: Provide an example of creating a role identifier with a password.
    answer: |
      Example of creating a role identifier and password for the inventory application of a bookstore:
      ```
      create role bks_onhand with password = 'hgwells';
      ```
  - question: Provide an example of creating a role identifier with no password.
    answer: |
      Example of creating a role identifier with no password for the daily sales application of the bookstore:
      ```
      create role dly_sales with nopassword;
      ```
