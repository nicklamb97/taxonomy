  - question: What is a DeclareBlock in programming in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      A DeclareBlock is used to declare local variables in a program.
  - question: What is the basic syntax of a DeclareBlock in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The basic syntax of a DeclareBlock is:
      declare {localvariabledeclaration} [enddeclare]
  - question: Is the 'enddeclare' keyword mandatory in a DeclareBlock in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      No, the 'enddeclare' keyword is optional in a DeclareBlock, as indicated by the square brackets in the syntax.
  - question: What does the term 'localvariabledeclaration' refer to in the DeclareBlock syntax in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The term 'localvariabledeclaration' refers to the declaration of local variables. For more details, one should
      refer to the LocalVariableDeclaration section.
  - question: Can multiple local variables be declared in a single DeclareBlock in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      Yes, multiple local variables can be declared in a single DeclareBlock. This is indicated by the curly braces
      {} around 'localvariabledeclaration' in the syntax, which suggest that multiple declarations are allowed.
  - question: What is the purpose of using a DeclareBlock in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The purpose of using a DeclareBlock is to declare local variables, which are typically used within a specific
      scope or block of code.
  - question: How does a DeclareBlock differ from global variable declarations in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      A DeclareBlock is specifically used for local variables, which have a limited scope, usually within the block
      or function where they are declared. Global variables, on the other hand, have a broader scope and are
      accessible throughout the entire program.
  - question: Where can I find more information about how to declare local variables in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      For more information about how to declare local variables, you should refer to the LocalVariableDeclaration
      section of the documentation.
  - question: Is the 'declare' keyword required to start a DeclareBlock in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      Yes, the 'declare' keyword is required to start a DeclareBlock, as shown in the syntax.
  - question: Can you explain the structure of a DeclareBlock in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      A DeclareBlock starts with the 'declare' keyword, followed by one or more local variable declarations. It can
      optionally end with the 'enddeclare' keyword. The actual variable declarations are defined in the
      LocalVariableDeclaration section.
