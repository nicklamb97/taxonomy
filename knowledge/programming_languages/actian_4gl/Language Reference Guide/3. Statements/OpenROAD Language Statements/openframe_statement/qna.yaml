task_description: Explain the concept and usage of 'Openframe Statement' in OpenROAD
  Actian 4GL.
created_by: willsjames
domain: actian_4gl
seed_examples:
  - question: What is the purpose of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Openframe Statement?
    answer: An Actian 4GL OpenROAD Openframe Statement opens a new frame to run concurrently
      with the calling ProcExec.
  - question: What is the basic syntax of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Openframe Statement?
    answer: 'The basic syntax is: [GhostExec_object =] openframe framename ([parameterlist])
      [withclause];'
  - question: How does the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Openframe Statement handle the framename
      parameter?
    answer: The framename is a dynamic name, allowing use of an actual frame name or
      a variable resolving to a frame name at runtime.
  - question: Can Actian 4GL OpenROAD Openframe Statements be nested?
    answer: Yes, opened frames can be nested. A called frame can call or open another
      frame, and so on.
  - question: What is the purpose of the GhostExec_object in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      Openframe Statement?
    answer: It's a reference variable of type GhostExec, assigned the GhostExec object
      of the opened frame for communication.
  - question: How can frames communicate in Actian 4GL OpenROAD when using the Openframe
      Statement?
    answer: Communication between frames is accomplished with the SendUserEvent Method.
  - question: What is the function of the withclause in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Openframe
      Statement?
    answer: The withclause can be used to set the ParentFrame attribute, determining
      the parent-child relationship of frames.
  - question: What happens if the ParentFrame attribute is set to null in an Actian
      4GL OpenROAD Openframe Statement?
    answer: If ParentFrame is null, the called frame runs as a detached frame, independent
      of other frames in the application.
  - question: Can the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Openframe Statement be used in an expression?
    answer: No, the Openframe Statement cannot be used in an expression.
  - question: How does control flow work when using an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Openframe
      Statement?
    answer: Control returns to the calling frame immediately after the new frame is
      opened, allowing concurrent execution.
