  - question: What is the purpose of the Endloop Statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: The Endloop Statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD is used to terminate a for,
      select, or while loop. It transfers control to the first statement following the
      terminated loop's endfor, end, or endwhile statement.
  - question: What is the syntax of the Endloop Statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: 'The syntax of the Endloop Statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD is:


      endloop [label];


      The ''label'' parameter is optional and specifies which loop to terminate.'
  - question: How does the Endloop Statement differ from the resume statement in Actian
      4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: In Actian 4GL OpenROAD, the Endloop Statement differs from the resume statement
      in that it only terminates the loop, while the resume statement can terminate
      both the loop and the current event block.
  - question: What is the difference between the Endloop Statement and the continue
      statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: In Actian 4GL OpenROAD, the Endloop Statement terminates the loop entirely,
      while the continue statement skips over remaining statements in the current iteration
      of a loop but continues with the next iteration.
  - question: Can you explain the 'label' parameter in the Endloop Statement of Actian
      4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: In the Endloop Statement of Actian 4GL OpenROAD, the 'label' parameter is
      optional. It specifies which loop to terminate, allowing for control of nested
      loops. The label must be a character string without quotation marks and cannot
      be a keyword.
  - question: How can the Endloop Statement be used with nested loops in Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD?
    answer: "In Actian 4GL OpenROAD, the Endloop Statement can be used with nested loops\
      \ by specifying a label. For example:\n\nB: while condition1 do\n   while condition2\
      \ do\n      if condition3 then\n         endloop B;\n      endif;\n   endwhile\n\
      endwhile;\n\nHere, 'endloop B' terminates both the inner and outer loops when\
      \ condition3 is true."
  - question: What happens if no label is specified in the Endloop Statement in Actian
      4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: If no label is specified in the Endloop Statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD,
      it terminates only the innermost loop that contains the endloop statement.
  - question: Can the Endloop Statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD be used with all types
      of loops?
    answer: Yes, the Endloop Statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD can be used with for loops,
      select loops, and while loops.
  - question: What is the effect of the Endloop Statement on the loop's index variable
      in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: The Endloop Statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD terminates the loop immediately.
      As a result, the loop's index variable (if any) is not incremented or decremented
      further, and its final value is undefined after the loop terminates.
  - question: How does the Endloop Statement contribute to flow control in Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD programs?
    answer: The Endloop Statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD contributes to flow control
      by providing a way to exit loops prematurely based on certain conditions. This
      allows for more flexible and efficient program execution, especially when dealing
      with complex or nested loop structures.
