  - question: What is the purpose of the prompt statement in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      The prompt statement displays a message in a pop-up window and accepts input from the application user, assigning
      the input to a variable.
  - question: What is the syntax for the prompt statement in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      The syntax for the prompt statement is:
      ```4gl
      variable = prompt varcharstringexpr;
      ```
  - question: How does the prompt statement display the message to the user?
    answer: |
      The prompt statement displays a character string message in a pop-up window centered in the calling frame,
      covering the calling frame until the user acknowledges the prompt.
  - question: What does the variable parameter in the prompt statement specify?
    answer: |
      The variable parameter specifies the name of a varchar variable to which the user's response is assigned. If the
      response is longer than the variable, OpenROAD truncates it on the right.
  - question: What does the varcharstringexpr parameter in the prompt statement specify?
    answer: |
      The varcharstringexpr parameter specifies the message to be displayed. It must be a varchar expression with a
      maximum length of 2000 characters.
  - question: Can you provide an example of using the prompt statement to get a report name from the user?
    answer: |
      Here is an example:
      ```4gl
      answer = prompt 'Enter the report name: ';
      ```
      This prompts the user for a report name and assigns the response to the variable 'answer'.
  - question: Can you provide an example of using the prompt statement to get a department name based on user input?
    answer: |
      Here is an example:
      ```4gl
      answer = prompt 'Enter the department for ' + fname + ' ' + lname;
      ```
      This prompts the user for the department of the person whose name appears in the 'fname' and 'lname' fields.
  - question: What happens if the user's response to the prompt statement is longer than the specified variable?
    answer: |
      If the user's response is longer than the specified variable, OpenROAD truncates the response on the right to fit
      into the variable.
  - question: How is the prompt window positioned on the screen in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      The prompt window is positioned in the center of the calling frame and covers the calling frame until the user
      acknowledges the prompt.
  - question: What is the maximum length for the varcharstringexpr in the prompt statement?
    answer: |
      The maximum length for the varcharstringexpr in the prompt statement is 2000 characters.
  - question: In what scenarios is the prompt statement typically used in Actian OpenROAD applications?
    answer: |
      The prompt statement is typically used in scenarios where the application needs to request specific input from the
      user, such as entering a report name or department information.
