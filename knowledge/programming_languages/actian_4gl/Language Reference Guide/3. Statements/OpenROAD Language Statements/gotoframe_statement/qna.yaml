  Actian 4GL.
created_by: willsjames
domain: actian_4gl
seed_examples:
  - question: What is the purpose of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Gotoframe Statement?
    answer: An Actian 4GL OpenROAD Gotoframe Statement passes control from the current
      frame to another frame, closing the current frame and its window.
  - question: What is the basic syntax of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Gotoframe Statement?
    answer: 'The basic syntax is: gotoframe framename([parameterlist]) [withclause];'
  - question: How does the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Gotoframe Statement differ from the Callframe
      Statement?
    answer: The Gotoframe Statement closes the calling frame and its window, while the
      Callframe Statement generally expects a return to the current frame.
  - question: Can you use the byref clause in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Gotoframe Statement?
    answer: No, you cannot use the byref clause in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Gotoframe
      Statement.
  - question: How does the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Gotoframe Statement handle frame name
      resolution?
    answer: If an actual frame name is used, it's resolved at compile time. If a variable
      is used, it's resolved at runtime.
  - question: What types of values can be passed in the parameter list of an Actian
      4GL OpenROAD Gotoframe Statement?
    answer: Values can be displayed or local variables from the calling frame, constants,
      or any legal 4GL expression.
  - question: Does the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Gotoframe Statement send a Terminate event
      to the closing frame?
    answer: No, the Gotoframe Statement does not send a Terminate event to the frame
      issuing the statement (the frame that is closing).
  - question: What happens if the current frame was called with an expected return value
      when using a Gotoframe Statement?
    answer: If a return value is expected, the last frame called by the Gotoframe Statement
      must complete the call sequence and provide the return value.
  - question: What is the requirement for return types when using an Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      Gotoframe Statement?
    answer: The return type of the called frame must be the same as that of the calling
      frame when using a Gotoframe Statement.
  - question: Can you provide an example of using an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Gotoframe Statement?
    answer: 'An example is: on click file.transfer = begin gotoframe nextframe(sequence
      = 3); end'
