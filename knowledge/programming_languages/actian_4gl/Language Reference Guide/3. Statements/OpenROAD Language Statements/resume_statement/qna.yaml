  - question: What is the purpose of the resume statement in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      The resume statement ends the currently executing event block and can control the flow of events in different
      ways.
  - question: What is the syntax for the resume statement in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      The syntax for the resume statement is:
      ```4gl
      resume [next];
      ```
  - question: What does the resume statement do without the next keyword?
    answer: |
      Without the next keyword, the resume statement ends the current operation and repositions the input focus on the
      field designated in CurFrame.InputFocusField.
  - question: How does the resume statement behave with the next keyword?
    answer: |
      With the next keyword, the resume statement gives control to the next pending event triggered by the original
      action in the event block.
  - question: What happens if the next keyword is omitted in the resume statement?
    answer: |
      If the next keyword is omitted, the field designated in the InputFocusField attribute is the one that last had the
      input focus when the event block was activated.
  - question: How does the resume statement handle multiple events?
    answer: |
      If the next keyword is not used, the resume statement discards any additional events triggered by user actions.
      With next, control resumes to the next event.
  - question: How does the resume statement interact with database and user events?
    answer: |
      A resume statement never discards pending database events and usually does not discard user events unless a
      SendUserEvent call affects focus behavior.
  - question: Where is the resume statement typically placed in an event block?
    answer: |
      The resume statement is typically the last statement in an event block or in the statement list of an if
      statement. Statements following it are not executed.
  - question: Can the resume statement be used in procedures in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      Yes, the resume statement can be used in local or global procedures, terminating the currently executing event
      block and all procedures above it in the call stack until a frame is found.
  - question: What happens if there is no current executing event block when a resume statement is used in a procedure?
    answer: |
      If no currently executing event block exists, the application is terminated.
  - question: Can you provide an example of using the resume statement to control input focus based on a field value?
    answer: |
      Here is an example:
      ```4gl
      on exit testfield =
      begin
          if testfield = 2 then
              CurFrame.InputFocusField = field(field2);
              resume;
          elseif testfield = 3 then
              CurFrame.InputFocusField = field(field3);
              resume;
          endif;
          /* processing statements for field1 */
      end
      ```
  - question: Can you provide an example of using the resume statement to validate a field and reposition input focus?
    answer: |
      Here is an example:
      ```4gl
      on setvalue vendor_num =
      begin
          select vendornum as tvnum
              from vendor
              where vendornum = :vendor_num;
          if iirowcount = 0 then
              message 'Vendor does not exist.';
              resume;
          endif;
      end
      ```
      If the vendor_num does not exist in the vendor table, an error message is displayed and control resumes on the
      vendor_num field.
