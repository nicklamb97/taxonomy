  - question: What is the purpose of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD If-Then-Else Statement?
    answer: An Actian 4GL OpenROAD If-Then-Else Statement chooses between alternative
      paths of execution, controlling the flow of an application by establishing logical
      relationships.
  - question: What is the basic syntax of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD If-Then-Else Statement?
    answer: 'The basic syntax is: if condition then statementlist [{elseif condition
      then statementlist}] [else statementlist] endif;'
  - question: What are the main variants of the Actian 4GL OpenROAD If-Then-Else Statement?
    answer: The main variants are if-then-endif, if-then-else-endif, and if-then-elseif-then-else-endif.
  - question: How does the if-then-endif variant of the Actian 4GL OpenROAD If-Then-Else
      Statement work?
    answer: In the if-then-endif variant, if the condition is true, the statements after
      'then' are executed. If false or null, execution continues after 'endif'.
  - question: What happens in the if-then-else-endif variant of the Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      If-Then-Else Statement?
    answer: In the if-then-else-endif variant, if the condition is true, statements
      after 'then' are executed. If false or null, statements after 'else' are executed.
  - question: How does the if-then-elseif-then-else-endif variant work in Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD?
    answer: This variant allows multiple conditions to be tested in sequence, executing
      the corresponding statementlist for the first true condition, or the 'else' block
      if all are false or null.
  - question: Can Actian 4GL OpenROAD If-Then-Else Statements be nested?
    answer: Yes, Actian 4GL OpenROAD If-Then-Else Statements can be nested within each
      other.
  - question: How can an Actian 4GL OpenROAD If-Then-Else Statement be used to control
      frame flow in an application?
    answer: It can be used to call different frames based on conditions, e.g., 'if status
      = 'n' then callframe new; elseif status = 'c' then callframe completed; else callframe
      inprogress; endif;'
  - question: What happens if all conditions in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD If-Then-Else
      Statement are false or null?
    answer: If all conditions are false or null and an 'else' clause is present, the
      statements in the 'else' block are executed. If no 'else' clause exists, no statements
      within the if structure are executed.
  - question: How can an Actian 4GL OpenROAD If-Then-Else Statement be used for input
      validation?
    answer: It can be used to check input and prompt for correct values, e.g., 'if empnum
      = 0 then enum = prompt 'Please enter employee number'; endif;'
