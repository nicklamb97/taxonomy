  - question: What is the purpose of the return statement in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      The return statement is used to close the current frame or called procedure and return to the calling frame or
      procedure. It can also pass a value back to the caller.
  - question: What is the syntax for the return statement in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      The syntax for the return statement is:
      ```4gl
      return [expression];
      ```
  - question: What does the return statement do when a frame is called by callframe?
    answer: |
      When a frame is called by callframe, the return statement closes the frame and returns control to the calling
      frame, procedure, or method at the statement following the callframe statement.
  - question: What happens when the return statement is used in a frame initiated through openframe?
    answer: |
      When used in a frame initiated through openframe, the return statement closes the frame, and the user must
      initiate interaction with an active frame.
  - question: How does the return statement behave when returning from a called procedure or method?
    answer: |
      When returning from a called procedure or method, the return statement passes control back to the calling frame,
      procedure, or method, resuming execution at the statement following the callproc statement or method invocation.
  - question: What does the return statement do to the parent of opened frames?
    answer: |
      The return statement sends a Terminate event to the parent of opened frames and then closes them.
  - question: What is the effect of the return statement on all active frames or procedures that are children?
    answer: |
      The return statement closes the entire application, functioning as an exit statement, if all active frames or
      procedures are children.
  - question: Can the return statement pass values back to the caller? If so, how?
    answer: |
      Yes, the return statement can pass a value, such as a return status, back to the calling frame, procedure, or
      method. The value must be compatible with the return data type defined in the visual development environment.
  - question: What happens to the return value when a frame is called with openframe?
    answer: |
      When a frame is called with openframe, any return value is ignored.
  - question: Can you provide an example of using the return statement to pass a value back to the calling frame?
    answer: |
      Certainly! Here is an example:
      ```4gl
      on click file.end =
      begin
          return status;
      end
      ```
  - question: Why is the return statement essential in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      The return statement is essential for controlling the flow of execution between different frames, procedures, and
      methods. It ensures proper closure of frames and passing of control and values back to the caller.
