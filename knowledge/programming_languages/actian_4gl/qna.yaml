  - question: What is the purpose of the IF-THEN-ELSE statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The IF-THEN-ELSE statement is a fundamental control structure in Actian 4GL that allows for conditional
      execution of code blocks based on specified conditions. It directs the flow of a program, enabling it to make
      decisions and execute specific code segments accordingly.

  - question: What is the basic syntax of the IF-THEN-ELSE statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The basic syntax of the IF-THEN-ELSE statement in Actian 4GL is:
      IF condition THEN
          statements
      ELSE IF condition THEN
          statements
      ELSE
          statements
      END IF

  - question: Are the ELSE IF and ELSE clauses mandatory in an IF-THEN-ELSE statement?
    answer: |
      No, the ELSE IF and ELSE clauses are optional. An IF statement can be as simple as a single condition and a
      single block of statements to execute if that condition is true.

  - question: What type of value must conditions in an IF-THEN-ELSE statement evaluate to?
    answer: |
      Conditions in an IF-THEN-ELSE statement must evaluate to a boolean value (TRUE or FALSE). Conditions are
      typically composed of comparisons or logical expressions.

  - question: Is Actian 4GL case-sensitive when it comes to IF-THEN-ELSE keywords?
    answer: |
      No, Actian 4GL is case-insensitive for keywords. So IF, if, and If are all valid. However, conventionally,
      all caps should be used for readability and consistency.

  - question: How are conditions evaluated in an IF-THEN-ELSE statement with multiple conditions?
    answer: |
      Conditions in an IF-THEN-ELSE statement are evaluated in sequence from top to bottom. As soon as a true
      condition is found, the corresponding block of statements is executed, and the remaining conditions are ignored.

  - question: What are some common comparison operators used in Actian 4GL IF-THEN-ELSE statements?
    answer: |
      Common comparison operators in Actian 4GL include:
      - = : Equal to
      - != or <> : Not equal to
      - < : Less than
      - > : Greater than
      - <= : Less than or equal to
      - >= : Greater than or equal to

  - question: What logical operators are available in Actian 4GL for combining or inverting conditions?
    answer: |
      The logical operators available in Actian 4GL are:
      - AND : Logical AND
      - OR : Logical OR
      - NOT : Logical NOT

  - question: Can multiple ELSE IF clauses be used in a single IF-THEN-ELSE statement?
    answer: |
      Yes, multiple ELSE IF clauses can be included in a single IF-THEN-ELSE statement to check additional
      conditions sequentially.

  - question: What happens when a condition in an IF-THEN-ELSE statement evaluates to true?
    answer: |
      When a condition in an IF-THEN-ELSE statement evaluates to true, the corresponding block of statements is
      executed, and the remaining conditions (if any) are ignored.
