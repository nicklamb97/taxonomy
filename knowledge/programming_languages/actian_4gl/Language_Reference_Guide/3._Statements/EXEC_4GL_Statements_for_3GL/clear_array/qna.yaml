  Overview of the Clear Array statement in OpenROAD, including syntax, parameter
  details, and usage examples.

seed_examples:
  - context: >
      The Clear Array statement in OpenROAD is used to remove all rows from a
      specified array, effectively resetting it to an empty state. This
      statement is useful in scenarios where you need to clear the contents of
      an array without deleting the array itself. It is important to ensure that
      the array handle provided is correct and that the array exists to avoid
      runtime errors. The statement can only clear one array at a time and does
      not affect arrays that do not exist or have not been previously defined.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What does the Clear Array statement do
        answer: >
          The Clear Array statement removes all rows from the specified array,
          effectively clearing its contents.
      - question: |
          What is the syntax for the Clear Array statement
        answer: |
          The syntax is `exec 4gl clear array arr`
      - question: |
          What is the parameter `arr` in the Clear Array statement
        answer: >
          The parameter `arr` specifies the handle of the array to clear. It is
          a 4-byte integer.
      - question: |
          Can you use the Clear Array statement to clear a non-existent array
        answer: >
          No, the statement can only clear arrays that exist and have been
          previously defined.
      - question: |
          How does clearing an array affect its memory usage
        answer: >
          Clearing an array removes all its rows, which can free up the memory
          previously allocated for those rows.
      - question: |
          What should you ensure before using the Clear Array statement
        answer: >
          Ensure that the array handle provided is correct and that the array
          exists to avoid runtime errors.
      - question: |
          Can you specify multiple arrays to clear in a single Clear Array
          statement
        answer: |
          No, the Clear Array statement can only clear one array at a time.
      - question: |
          What happens if the Clear Array statement is executed on an array with
          no rows
        answer: >
          Executing the statement on an array with no rows has no effect; the
          array remains empty.
      - question: |
          How would you clear an array named `employeeArray`
        answer: |
          You would use the statement `exec 4gl clear array employeeArray`
      - question: |
          Can you use the Clear Array statement to clear elements from a
          specific index
        answer: >
          No, the Clear Array statement clears all rows from the array, not
          specific elements or indices.

  - context: >
      The Clear Array statement in OpenROAD allows for efficient resetting of arrays.
      It is particularly useful when you need to ensure that an array is emptied
      between operations or before reusing it. The statement simplifies memory
      management by removing all elements from the array at once.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why is the Clear Array statement useful in OpenROAD?
        answer: >
          It is useful for efficiently resetting arrays by removing all rows
          at once, simplifying memory management and reuse.
      - question: |
          Can the Clear Array statement be used in different scenarios?
        answer: >
          Yes, it can be used in various scenarios where an empty array is needed
          for further processing or operations.
      - question: |
          What precaution should be taken when using the Clear Array statement?
        answer: >
          Ensure that the array handle provided is valid and that the array exists
          to prevent runtime errors.
      - question: |
          How does the Clear Array statement compare to other methods of clearing
          data?
        answer: >
          The Clear Array statement provides a single command to remove all rows,
          whereas other methods might require more complex operations.
      - question: |
          Is there any effect on the array handle after clearing the array?
        answer: >
          The array handle remains valid, but the array itself is empty.

  - context: >
      Clearing an array with the Clear Array statement is straightforward but
      requires understanding its implications. It does not delete the array but
      removes its contents, which is important for managing memory and array
      states in OpenROAD applications.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the difference between clearing and deleting an array?
        answer: >
          Clearing an array removes its contents but keeps the array structure,
          whereas deleting an array removes both its contents and structure.
      - question: |
          How can clearing an array benefit memory management?
        answer: >
          By removing all rows, it helps to free up memory previously allocated
          for the array’s contents.
      - question: |
          Can the Clear Array statement affect performance?
        answer: >
          It can impact performance if used frequently in large applications,
          but it is generally efficient for managing array contents.
      - question: |
          How can you confirm that an array has been cleared?
        answer: >
          You can check the array's length or row count to verify that it has been
          emptied.
      - question: |
          What happens to the array data after execution of the Clear Array statement?
        answer: >
          All data within the array is removed, leaving the array empty.

  - context: >
      In some cases, the Clear Array statement might be used as part of larger
      operations within OpenROAD scripts. Understanding its usage helps in
      ensuring that arrays are correctly managed and no unnecessary data remains.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What role does the Clear Array statement play in scripts?
        answer: >
          It helps manage arrays by clearing their contents as part of script
          operations, ensuring no residual data remains.
      - question: |
          How can incorrect usage of the Clear Array statement impact your application?
        answer: >
          Incorrect usage can lead to runtime errors if the array does not exist
          or the handle is incorrect.
      - question: |
          What is an example of using Clear Array in a script?
        answer: >
          Using `exec 4gl clear array myArray` to reset `myArray` before re-populating
          it with new data.
      - question: |
          Are there any restrictions on the Clear Array statement?
        answer: >
          It can only clear one array at a time and requires a valid array handle.
      - question: |
          How often should the Clear Array statement be used in an application?
        answer: >
          Use it as needed, particularly when resetting arrays or managing memory
          between operations.

  - context: >
      The Clear Array statement is part of OpenROAD’s data manipulation capabilities.
      Knowing how and when to use it ensures efficient data management and operation
      execution.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the main purpose of the Clear Array statement in OpenROAD?
        answer: >
          Its main purpose is to clear all rows from a specified array, resetting it
          to an empty state.
      - question: |
          Can the Clear Array statement be part of a transaction?
        answer: >
          Yes, it can be used within transactions to ensure arrays are cleared
          as part of the transaction's operations.
      - question: |
          What should you verify before executing the Clear Array statement?
        answer: >
          Verify that the array handle is correct and that the array exists to
          avoid errors.
      - question: |
          How does Clear Array help in data management?
        answer: >
          It helps by resetting arrays to an empty state, making it easier to manage
          and reuse them.
      - question: |
          Can Clear Array be undone?
        answer: >
          No, once executed, the rows are removed and cannot be recovered.
