      The Clear Array statement requires the `arr` parameter, which specifies
      the handle of the array to clear. This handle is a 4-byte integer.
  - question: >-
      Does the Clear Array statement remove specific rows or all rows from the
      array?
    answer: >
      The Clear Array statement removes all rows from the specified array,
      effectively clearing the entire array.
