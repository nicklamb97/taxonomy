  - question: What is the purpose of the Clear Array statement in OpenROAD?
    answer: >
      The purpose of the Clear Array statement in OpenROAD is to remove all the
      rows from a specified array, effectively clearing its contents.
  - question: What is the syntax for the Clear Array statement in OpenROAD?
    answer: >
      The syntax for the Clear Array statement in OpenROAD is: ``` exec 4gl
      clear array arr; ``` - `arr`: Specifies the handle of the array to clear.
      It is a 4-byte integer.
  - question: >-
      How is the Clear Array statement similar to the Clear method used with the
      ArrayObject class?
    answer: >
      The Clear Array statement is similar to the Clear method used with the
      ArrayObject class because both are used to remove all rows from a
      specified array, effectively clearing its contents.
  - question: What parameter does the Clear Array statement require?
    answer: >
      The Clear Array statement requires the `arr` parameter, which specifies
      the handle of the array to clear. This handle is a 4-byte integer.
  - question: >-
      Does the Clear Array statement remove specific rows or all rows from the
      array?
    answer: >
      The Clear Array statement removes all rows from the specified array,
      effectively clearing the entire array.
  - question: Can you use the Clear Array statement on a non-existent array?
    answer: >
      No, the Clear Array statement can only be used on arrays that exist and
      have been previously defined.
  - question: >-
      What happens if you execute the Clear Array statement on an already empty
      array?
    answer: >
      If you execute the Clear Array statement on an already empty array, it has
      no effect; the array remains empty.
  - question: How do you clear an array named `dataArray` in OpenROAD?
    answer: >
      To clear an array named `dataArray`, you would use the statement: ``` exec
      4gl clear array dataArray; ```
  - question: >-
      What is a key difference between the Clear Array statement and manually
      removing rows from an array?
    answer: >
      The key difference is that the Clear Array statement removes all rows from
      the array in a single command, whereas manually removing rows requires
      iterative commands.
  - question: What should you ensure before using the Clear Array statement?
    answer: >
      Before using the Clear Array statement, you should ensure that the array
      handle provided is correct and that the array exists to avoid runtime
      errors.
  - question: How does the Clear Array statement affect memory usage of the array?
    answer: >
      The Clear Array statement removes all rows from the array, which can free
      up the memory previously allocated for those rows.
  - question: >-
      Is it possible to clear multiple arrays at once with a single Clear Array
      statement?
    answer: |
      No, the Clear Array statement can only clear one array at a time.
  - question: Can the Clear Array statement be used within a transaction in OpenROAD?
    answer: >
      Yes, the Clear Array statement can be used within a transaction to ensure
      the array is cleared as part of the transaction.
  - question: >-
      How can you confirm that an array has been successfully cleared after
      using the Clear Array statement?
    answer: >
      You can confirm that an array has been successfully cleared by checking
      the array's length or row count to ensure it has been reset to zero.
  - question: Is the Clear Array statement undoable once executed?
    answer: >
      No, once the Clear Array statement is executed, the rows are removed and
      cannot be recovered through the statement.
  - question: >-
      Why is the Clear Array statement important for managing data in OpenROAD
      applications?
    answer: >
      The Clear Array statement is important for managing data in OpenROAD
      applications because it provides an efficient way to reset arrays,
      ensuring that they do not retain unwanted rows or residual data.
