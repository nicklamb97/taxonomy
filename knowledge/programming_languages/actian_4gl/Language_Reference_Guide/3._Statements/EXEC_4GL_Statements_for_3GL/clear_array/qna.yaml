  Overview of the Clear Array statement in OpenROAD, including syntax, parameter
  details, and usage examples.

  - context: >
      The Clear Array statement in OpenROAD is used to remove all rows from a
      specified array, effectively resetting it to an empty state. This
      statement is useful in scenarios where you need to clear the contents of
      an array without deleting the array itself. It is important to ensure that
      the array handle provided is correct and that the array exists to avoid
      runtime errors. The statement can only clear one array at a time and does
      not affect arrays that do not exist or have not been previously defined.

      - question: >
          What does the Clear Array statement do
        answer: >
          The Clear Array statement removes all rows from the specified array,
          effectively clearing its contents.
      - question: >
          What is the syntax for the Clear Array statement
        answer: >
          The syntax is `exec 4gl clear array arr`
      - question: >
          What is the parameter `arr` in the Clear Array statement
        answer: >
          The parameter `arr` specifies the handle of the array to clear. It is
          a 4-byte integer.
      - question: >
          Can you use the Clear Array statement to clear a non-existent array
        answer: >
          No, the statement can only clear arrays that exist and have been
          previously defined.
      - question: >
          How does clearing an array affect its memory usage
        answer: >
          Clearing an array removes all its rows, which can free up the memory
          previously allocated for those rows.
      - question: >
          What should you ensure before using the Clear Array statement
        answer: >
          Ensure that the array handle provided is correct and that the array
          exists to avoid runtime errors.
      - question: >
          Can you specify multiple arrays to clear in a single Clear Array
          statement
        answer: >
          No, the Clear Array statement can only clear one array at a time.
      - question: >
          What happens if the Clear Array statement is executed on an array with
          no rows
        answer: >
          Executing the statement on an array with no rows has no effect; the
          array remains empty.
      - question: >
          How would you clear an array named `employeeArray`
        answer: >
          You would use the statement `exec 4gl clear array employeeArray`
      - question: >
          Can you use the Clear Array statement to clear elements from a
          specific index
        answer: >
          No, the Clear Array statement clears all rows from the array, not
          specific elements or indices.
