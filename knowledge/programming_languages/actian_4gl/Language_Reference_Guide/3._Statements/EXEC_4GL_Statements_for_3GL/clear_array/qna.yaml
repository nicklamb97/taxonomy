      - question: Can you use the Clear Array statement to clear a non-existent array?
        answer: No, the statement can only clear arrays that exist and have been previously defined.
      - question: How does clearing an array affect its memory usage?
        answer: Clearing an array removes all its rows, which can free up the memory previously allocated for those rows.
      - question: What should you ensure before using the Clear Array statement?
        answer: Ensure that the array handle provided is correct and that the array exists to avoid runtime errors.
      - question: Can you specify multiple arrays to clear in a single Clear Array statement?
        answer: No, the Clear Array statement can only clear one array at a time.
      - question: What happens if the Clear Array statement is executed on an array with no rows?
        answer: Executing the statement on an array with no rows has no effect; the array remains empty.
      - question: How would you clear an array named `employeeArray`?
        answer: You would use the statement: `exec 4gl clear array employeeArray;`
      - question: Can you use the Clear Array statement to clear elements from a specific index?
        answer: No, the Clear Array statement clears all rows from the array, not specific elements or indices.
      - question: After clearing an array, how can you confirm that it is empty?
        answer: You can check the array's length or row count to confirm that it has been cleared.
