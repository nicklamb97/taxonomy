  Overview of the Clear Array statement in OpenROAD, including syntax, parameter
  details, and usage examples.
seed_examples:
  - context: >-
      The Clear Array statement in OpenROAD is used to remove all rows from a
      specified array. This effectively resets the array to an empty state. The
      statement is similar to the clear method in the ArrayObject class.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the Clear Array statement do
        answer: >-
          The Clear Array statement removes all rows from the specified array,
          effectively clearing its contents.
      - question: What is the syntax for the Clear Array statement
        answer: The syntax is `exec 4gl clear array arr`
      - question: What is the parameter `arr` in the Clear Array statement
        answer: >-
          The parameter `arr` specifies the handle of the array to clear. It is
          a 4-byte integer.
      - question: How does the Clear Array statement affect the specified array
        answer: It removes all rows from the specified array, leaving it empty.
      - question: >-
          Is the Clear Array statement similar to any method in the ArrayObject
          class
        answer: >-
          Yes, it is similar to the Clear method used with the ArrayObject
          class.
      - question: What type of value does the `arr` parameter represent
        answer: >-
          The `arr` parameter represents the handle of the array, which is a
          4-byte integer.
      - question: Can you use the Clear Array statement to clear a non-existent array
        answer: >-
          No, the statement can only clear arrays that exist and have been
          previously defined.
      - question: How does clearing an array affect its memory usage
        answer: >-
          Clearing an array removes all its rows, which can free up the memory
          previously allocated for those rows.
      - question: What should you ensure before using the Clear Array statement
        answer: >-
          Ensure that the array handle provided is correct and that the array
          exists to avoid runtime errors.
      - question: >-
          Can you specify multiple arrays to clear in a single Clear Array
          statement
        answer: No, the Clear Array statement can only clear one array at a time.
      - question: >-
          What happens if the Clear Array statement is executed on an array with
          no rows
        answer: >-
          Executing the statement on an array with no rows has no effect; the
          array remains empty.
      - question: How would you clear an array named `employeeArray`
        answer: You would use the statement `exec 4gl clear array employeeArray`
      - question: >-
          Can you use the Clear Array statement to clear elements from a
          specific index
        answer: >-
          No, the Clear Array statement clears all rows from the array, not
          specific elements or indices.
      - question: After clearing an array, how can you confirm that it is empty
        answer: >-
          You can check the length of an array or its row count to confirm that it has
          been cleared.
      - question: Why would you use the Clear Array statement in OpenROAD
        answer: >-
          You would use the Clear Array statement to reset an array to an empty
          state by removing all its rows.
      - question: >-
          What effect does the Clear Array statement have on the rows of an
          array
        answer: It removes all rows, leaving the array empty.
      - question: Can the Clear Array statement be used on any array in OpenROAD
        answer: >-
          Yes, as long as the array handle is correctly specified and the array
          exists.
      - question: >-
          Is there a difference between using the Clear Array statement and
          manually removing rows from an array
        answer: >-
          Yes, the Clear Array statement provides a single command to remove all
          rows, whereas manually removing rows requires iterative commands.
      - question: How does the Clear Array statement ensure the array is empty
        answer: By removing all rows, it ensures the array contains no data.
      - question: What is the purpose of the Clear Array statement in OpenROAD
        answer: >-
          Its purpose is to clear all rows from a specified array, resetting it
          to an empty state.
      - question: >-
          What happens to the array handle after executing the Clear Array
          statement
        answer: The array handle remains valid, but the array itself is empty.
      - question: Can the Clear Array statement be used within a transaction in OpenROAD
        answer: >-
          Yes, it can be used within a transaction to ensure the array is
          cleared as part of the transaction.
      - question: Does the Clear Array statement free the memory allocated to the array
        answer: >-
          It can help free memory by removing rows, but the array handle itself
          still exists.
      - question: >-
          How is the Clear Array statement similar to the Clear method in the
          ArrayObject class
        answer: >-
          Both are used to remove all rows from an array, effectively clearing
          its contents.
      - question: >-
          What must you verify about an array before using the Clear Array
          statement
        answer: >-
          You must verify that the array handle is correct and that the array
          exists.
      - question: What is the effect of the Clear Array statement on an empty array
        answer: It has no effect; the array remains empty.
      - question: How does the Clear Array statement help in memory management
        answer: >-
          By clearing rows, it can help free up memory previously used by the
          array.
      - question: >-
          Is it possible to use the Clear Array statement to remove only certain
          rows
        answer: No, it removes all rows from the array.
      - question: >-
          What is a key difference between the Clear Array statement and other
          methods of clearing data
        answer: >-
          The Clear Array statement is a single command that clears all rows at
          once, whereas other methods may require iterative commands.
      - question: Why is the Clear Array statement important in OpenROAD programming
        answer: >-
          It allows for efficient resetting of arrays by removing all rows in a
          single command.
      - question: What precaution should you take before using the Clear Array statement
        answer: >-
          Ensure that the array handle is correct and that the array exists to
          prevent errors.
      - question: How does the Clear Array statement impact the data within the array
        answer: It removes all rows, effectively clearing all data from the array.
      - question: Can the Clear Array statement be undone
        answer: >-
          No, once executed, the rows are removed and cannot be recovered
          through the statement.
      - question: What is the role of the `arr` parameter in the Clear Array statement
        answer: It specifies the handle of the array to be cleared.
