  - question: What is the purpose of EXEC 4GL statements in OpenROAD?
    answer: >
      EXEC 4GL statements in OpenROAD are used in Embedded SQL for C (ESQL/C)
      programs to pass objects and arrays between 3GL and 4GL routines. They
      allow structured data to be handled and transferred between the two
      environments.
  - question: What is the general syntax of an EXEC 4GL statement?
    answer: >
      The general syntax of an EXEC 4GL statement is:

      ```

      exec 4gl 4gl_statement [terminator]

      ```

      - `4gl_statement`: Specifies one of the 4GL statements.

      - `terminator`: Specifies a termination character for the statement,
      typically a semi-colon (;).
  - question: Where must the EXEC 4GL keywords be placed in an ESQL/C program?
    answer: >
      The EXEC 4GL keywords must be placed before each 4GL statement in an
      Embedded SQL for C (ESQL/C) program. This syntax is similar to that for
      Embedded SQL and SQL/Forms.
  - question: Can EXEC 4GL statements be used outside of Embedded SQL programs?
    answer: >
      No, EXEC 4GL statements can only be used in Embedded SQL programs that are
      designed to pass objects and arrays between 3GL and 4GL routines.
  - question: >-
      How is structured data passed to 3GL in the context of EXEC 4GL
      statements?
    answer: >
      Structured data is passed to 3GL as a handle, which is referenced in the
      EXEC 4GL statements whenever an object or array needs to be indicated.
      This handle is always a 4-byte integer.
  - question: >-
      What should you consult for more information about using handles and
      passing objects and arrays between 4GL and 3GL routines?
    answer: >
      For more information about using handles and passing objects and arrays
      between 4GL and 3GL routines, you should consult the Programming Guide.
