      specifying optional parameters.

    answer: 'The basic syntax is: call subsystem ([parametername = value {, parametername
      = value}]);'
  - question: How does an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Call Statement affect the calling application?
    answer: The Call Statement blocks all frames in the calling OpenROAD application
      until the user exits from the called subsystem.
  - question: What happens when an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Call Statement is issued within
      a transaction?
    answer: If issued within a transaction, the Call Statement commits the transaction
      without a warning before invoking the subsystem.

      value of the parameter).

      application stored in the same database.
