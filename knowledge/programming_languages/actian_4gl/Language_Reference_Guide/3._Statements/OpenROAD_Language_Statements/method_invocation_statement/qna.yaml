  - question: What is the purpose of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Method Invocation Statement?
    answer: An Actian 4GL OpenROAD Method Invocation Statement invokes a method that
      is defined on a class of a reference variable.
  - question: What is the basic syntax of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Method Invocation Statement?
    answer: 'The basic syntax is: [returnvariable =] referencevariable.method(parameterlist);'
  - question: What types of methods can be invoked using an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Method
      Invocation Statement?
    answer: Methods of user classes, system classes, and external classes can be invoked.
  - question: Can inherited methods be invoked using an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Method Invocation
      Statement?
    answer: Yes, any inherited method from the variable's superclasses can be invoked.
  - question: Are parameters always required in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Method Invocation
      Statement?
    answer: No, parameters can be optional, but parentheses must always be included
      even if no parameters are specified.
  - question: How are parameters specified in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Method Invocation
      Statement?
    answer: Parameters can be specified in any order, and their names are dynamic and
      can be specified at runtime.
  - question: What is the purpose of the returnvariable in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Method
      Invocation Statement?
    answer: The returnvariable receives the return value from the method. Its data type
      must match the method's return type.
  - question: What is the referencevariable in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Method Invocation
      Statement?
    answer: The referencevariable is the name of a reference variable or an expression
      that resolves to a reference variable.
  - question: Can an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Method Invocation Statement be used as part
      of an expression?
    answer: Yes, a method can be invoked as part of an expression.
  - question: How are parameters specified differently for system/user classes vs external
      classes in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: For system/user classes, NamedParameterList is used. For external classes,
      UnnamedParameterList is used.
