  - question: What is the syntax of the register dbevent statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the register dbevent statement is as follows:
      ```
      register dbevent [schema.]event_name;
      ```

  - question: What does the register dbevent statement do?
    answer: |
      The register dbevent statement enables a session to specify the database
      events it intends to receive. A session receives only the database events
      for which it has registered.

  - question: What is the parameter of the register dbevent statement?
    answer: |
      The register dbevent statement has one parameter:
      - event_name: Specifies the database event name to register.

  - question: How can you remove a registration for a database event?
    answer: |
      To remove a registration for a database event, use the remove statement.

  - question: What events can a session register for?
    answer: |
      A session can register for events:
      - Owned by the session's effective user
      - For which register privilege has been granted

  - question: What happens if you try to register for a nonexistent event or an event without proper privileges?
    answer: |
      If an attempt is made to register for a nonexistent event, for an event for
      which register privilege has not been granted, or twice for the same event,
      the DBMS Server issues an error.

  - question: What happens if the schema parameter is omitted in the register dbevent statement?
    answer: |
      If the schema parameter is omitted, the DBMS Server first checks the events
      owned by the current user. If the specified event is not found, the DBMS Server
      checks the events owned by the DBA.

  - question: What happens if the register dbevent statement is issued within a transaction that is subsequently rolled
      back?
    answer: |
      If the register dbevent statement is issued from within a transaction that is
      subsequently rolled back, the registration remains in effect.

  - question: What permissions are required to register for an event you do not own?
    answer: |
      To register for an event you do not own, you must:
      1. Specify the schema parameter
      2. Have REGISTER privilege for the database event

  - question: How can you assign REGISTER privilege to another user?
    answer: |
      To assign REGISTER privilege to another user, use the grant statement.
      Refer to the Grant (privilege) Statement for more information.
