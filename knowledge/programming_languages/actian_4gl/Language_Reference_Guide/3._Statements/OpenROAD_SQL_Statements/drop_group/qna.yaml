  - question: What is the syntax of the drop group statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the drop group statement in Ingres is as follows:
      ```
      drop group group_id {, group_id};
      ```
  - question: What does the drop group statement do?
    answer: |
      The drop group statement removes the specified group identifiers from the installation. If any of the specified
      identifiers does not exist, the DBMS Server returns an error but does not abort the statement. Other valid
      existing group_ids in the statement are deleted.
  - question: What is a requirement for a group identifier to be dropped?
    answer: |
      A group identifier must be empty, that is, have no users in its user list, before it can be dropped. If an attempt
      is made to drop a group identifier that still has members in its user list, the DBMS Server returns an error and
      does not delete the identifier.
  - question: What happens if you try to drop a group identifier that has members?
    answer: |
      If you try to drop a group identifier that still has members in its user list, the DBMS Server returns an error
      and does not delete the identifier. However, the statement is not aborted, and other group identifiers in the list
      are deleted, if they are empty.
  - question: How can you empty a group's user list before dropping it?
    answer: |
      Use the alter group statement to drop all the users from a group's user list before dropping the group identifier.
  - question: What permissions are required to drop a group?
    answer: |
      To drop a group, you must have MAINTAIN_USERS privilege and be connected to the iidbdb database. This ensures
      only authorized users can remove group identifiers.
  - question: What happens to a session using a group identifier when it is dropped?
    answer: |
      Any session using a group identifier when it is dropped continues to run with the privileges defined for that
      group. This ensures ongoing sessions are not disrupted by the drop operation.
  - question: Can you provide an example of the drop group statement?
    answer: |
      Here are examples of the drop group statement:
      ```
      -- Drop the group identifier, acct_clerk.
      drop group acct_clerk;
      -- In an application, drop the group identifiers, tel_sales and temp_clerk.
      drop group tel_sales, temp_clerk;
      ```
  - question: What related statements should I know about for managing groups?
    answer: |
      Related statements for managing groups include:
      - Alter Group Statement
      - Create Group Statement
