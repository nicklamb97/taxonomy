  in OpenROAD Actian 4GL.

domain: actian_4gl
seed_examples:
  - question: How does Actian 4GL OpenROAD handle nulls in aggregate functions?
    answer: In Actian 4GL OpenROAD, aggregate functions ignore nulls when executed against
      a column containing nulls.
  - question: Why is it important that nulls are ignored in aggregate functions in Actian
      4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: Ignoring nulls prevents unknown or inapplicable values from affecting the
      result of the aggregate.
  - question: What is the behavior of the count() function for empty sets in Actian
      4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: In Actian 4GL OpenROAD, the count() function returns 0 for an empty set,
      unlike other aggregate functions.
  - question: What do other aggregate functions return for empty sets in Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD?
    answer: In Actian 4GL OpenROAD, aggregate functions other than count() return null
      for an empty set.
  - question: How can you handle null results from aggregate functions in Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD?
    answer: You can use the ifnull function to return a specific value (e.g., 0) instead
      of null in Actian 4GL OpenROAD.
  - question: How are nulls treated in grouping columns for aggregate functions in Actian
      4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: In Actian 4GL OpenROAD, nulls in grouping columns are treated as equal for
      grouping purposes.
  - question: What is the exception to the rule that nulls are not equal to other nulls
      in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: The exception is when nulls are in a grouping column for an aggregate function
      in Actian 4GL OpenROAD.
  - question: How would you use the ifnull function with max() in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: 'In Actian 4GL OpenROAD, you can use: select ifnull(max(column),0) as x
      from table;'
  - question: What happens if avg() is applied to a column with nulls in Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD?
    answer: In Actian 4GL OpenROAD, avg() will ignore the nulls and calculate the average
      of all known values.
  - question: Why is it important to handle nulls correctly in aggregate functions in
      Actian 4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: Correct null handling prevents distortion of results, such as incorrect
      averages, in Actian 4GL OpenROAD.
