  - answer: A LocalProcedureDeclaration is used to declare the name and return type
      of a local procedure defined within the script in OpenROAD Actian 4GL.
    question: What is a LocalProcedureDeclaration in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?
  - answer: 'The basic syntax is:

      localprocname = procedure [returning [typewithoutdefault | none]];'
    question: What is the basic syntax of a LocalProcedureDeclaration?
  - answer: No, specifying a return type is optional. The 'returning' clause is enclosed
      in square brackets, indicating it's optional.
    question: Is specifying a return type mandatory in a LocalProcedureDeclaration?
  - answer: '''localprocname'' specifies the name of the local procedure defined within
      the script.'
    question: What does 'localprocname' represent in the LocalProcedureDeclaration syntax?
  - answer: You can specify either a 'typewithoutdefault' or 'none' as the return type.
      If 'none' is specified, it indicates the procedure doesn't return a value.
    question: What are the options for specifying the return type in a LocalProcedureDeclaration?
  - answer: For more information about the types that can be used, you should refer
      to the TypeWithoutDefault section of the documentation.
    question: Where can I find more information about the types that can be used in
      a LocalProcedureDeclaration?
  - answer: Yes, the 'procedure' keyword is required in a LocalProcedureDeclaration,
      as shown in the syntax.
    question: Is the 'procedure' keyword required in a LocalProcedureDeclaration?
  - answer: A LocalProcedureDeclaration is used for procedures that are only accessible
      within the script where they are defined, while global procedures have a broader
      scope and can be accessed from other parts of the program.
    question: How does a LocalProcedureDeclaration differ from a global procedure declaration?
  - answer: Yes, multiple local procedures can be declared in a script. Each would require
      its own LocalProcedureDeclaration.
    question: Can multiple local procedures be declared in a script?
  - answer: Local procedures in OpenROAD Actian 4GL are used to encapsulate functionality
      that is only needed within a specific script, promoting code organization and
      modularity.
    question: What is the purpose of using local procedures in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?
