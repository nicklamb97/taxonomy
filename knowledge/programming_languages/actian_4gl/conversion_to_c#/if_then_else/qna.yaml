  - question: What are the main variables used in the C# and Actian 4GL examples?
    answer: |
      The main variables used in both examples are:
      - age: An integer representing the person's age
      - isPremiumMember: A boolean indicating if the person is a premium member
      - totalPurchase: A decimal (or double in C#) representing the total purchase amount
      - membershipStatus: A string representing the membership status ("Premium" or "Regular")
      - isEligibleForDiscount: A boolean indicating if the person is eligible for a discount
  - question: How is the membership status determined in both languages?
    answer: |
      In C#, the membership status is determined using a ternary operator:
      string membershipStatus = isPremiumMember ? "Premium" : "Regular";

      In Actian 4GL, it's determined using an IF-ELSE statement:
      IF isPremiumMember THEN
          LET membershipStatus = "Premium"
      ELSE
          LET membershipStatus = "Regular"
      END IF
  - question: Explain the complex conditional expression for discount eligibility in C#.
    answer: |
      The complex conditional expression in C# is:
      bool isEligibleForDiscount =
         isPremiumMember ? true :
         (membershipStatus == "Regular" && (age > 60 || totalPurchase > 100));

      This expression first checks if the person is a premium member. If true, they're eligible for a discount.
      If not, it checks if they're a regular member AND either their age is over 60 OR their total purchase is
      over $100.
  - question: How is the discount eligibility determined in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      In Actian 4GL, discount eligibility is determined using nested IF statements:
      IF isPremiumMember THEN
          LET isEligibleForDiscount = TRUE
      ELSE
          IF membershipStatus = "Regular" AND (age > 60 OR totalPurchase > 100) THEN
              LET isEligibleForDiscount = TRUE
          ELSE
              LET isEligibleForDiscount = FALSE
          END IF
      END IF
  - question: What is the difference in variable declaration between C# and Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      In C#, variables are declared with their type and can be initialized in the same line:
      int age = 65;
      bool isPremiumMember = false;
      double totalPurchase = 120.50;

      In Actian 4GL, variables are declared using the DEFINE keyword and initialized separately:
      DEFINE age INTEGER
      DEFINE isPremiumMember BOOLEAN
      DEFINE totalPurchase DECIMAL(10,2)

      LET age = 65
      LET isPremiumMember = FALSE
      LET totalPurchase = 120.50
  - question: How is output handled in C# versus Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      In C#, output is handled using Console.WriteLine with string interpolation:
      Console.WriteLine($"Age: {age}");
      Console.WriteLine($"Membership Status: {membershipStatus}");

      In Actian 4GL, output is handled using the DISPLAY statement:
      DISPLAY "Age: ", age
      DISPLAY "Membership Status: ", membershipStatus
  - question: What is the purpose of the totalPurchase variable in both examples?
    answer: |
      The totalPurchase variable represents the total amount of the person's purchase. It's used as part of the
      condition to determine discount eligibility. If the person is not a premium member and their age is not over 60,
      they can still be eligible for a discount if their total purchase is over $100.
  - question: How does the code handle premium members differently from regular members?
    answer: |
      In both C# and Actian 4GL versions, premium members are automatically eligible for the discount. For regular
      members, additional conditions (age > 60 or totalPurchase > 100) must be met to be eligible for the discount.
  - question: What data type is used for the totalPurchase variable in C# and Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      In C#, the totalPurchase variable is declared as a double:
      double totalPurchase = 120.50;

      In Actian 4GL it's declared as a DECIMAL with 10 digits total and 2 decimal places:
      DEFINE totalPurchase DECIMAL(10,2)
  - question: How would you modify the Actian 4GL code to include a new condition for discount eligibility?
    answer: |
      To add a new condition for discount eligibility in Actian 4GL, you would modify the nested IF statement. For
      example, to add a condition that customers with a loyalty card are also eligible:

      DEFINE hasLoyaltyCard BOOLEAN
      LET hasLoyaltyCard = TRUE

      IF isPremiumMember THEN
          LET isEligibleForDiscount = TRUE
      ELSE
          IF membershipStatus = "Regular" AND (age > 60 OR totalPurchase > 100 OR hasLoyaltyCard) THEN
              LET isEligibleForDiscount = TRUE
          ELSE
              LET isEligibleForDiscount = FALSE
          END IF
      END IF
