  - question: How does Actian 4GL in OpenROAD represent class objects?
    answer: |
      Actian 4GL in OpenROAD uses XML to represent class objects. These XML representations can be directly
      converted to C#.

  - question: What is the C# equivalent of varchar(1) in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      In Actian 4GL, `varchar(1)` can be represented as a `char` in C#.

  - question: What is the root element in the XML representation of an Actian 4GL class?
    answer: |
      The root element in the XML representation of an Actian 4GL class is `<OPENROAD>`.

  - question: What does the `<COMPONENT>` element represent in the XML structure?
    answer: |
      The `<COMPONENT>` element defines a specific component. It has attributes like `name` and `xsi:type` that
      specify the component's name and type respectively.

  - question: How is inheritance represented in the XML structure?
    answer: |
      Inheritance is represented using the `<superclass>` element. It specifies the superclass from which the
      component inherits behavior and properties.

  - question: What is the purpose of the `<attributes>` element in the XML structure?
    answer: |
      The `<attributes>` element encapsulates a list of attributes or fields that describe the properties of the
      component. It contains multiple `<row>` elements, each defining a specific attribute.

  - question: How are individual attributes defined in the XML structure?
    answer: |
      Individual attributes are defined using `<row>` elements within the `<attributes>` section. Each `<row>`
      contains a `<displayname>` (identifier) and a `<datatype>` (specifying the data type of the attribute).

  - question: What does the `<row_class>` element represent?
    answer: |
      The `<row_class>` element possibly indicates a classification or type associated with the rows within
      `<attributes>`. It could denote a specific category or classification of attributes within the component.

  - question: What namespace is declared in the XML representation?
    answer: |
      The XML representation declares a namespace prefix `xsi` associated with a specific URL (SOME_URL). This prefix
      is typically used for attributes in XML that indicate schema information.

  - question: How is the component type specified in the XML structure?
    answer: |
      The component type is specified using the `xsi:type` attribute in the `<COMPONENT>` element. For example,
      `xsi:type="somesource"` indicates that the component is of type "somesource".
