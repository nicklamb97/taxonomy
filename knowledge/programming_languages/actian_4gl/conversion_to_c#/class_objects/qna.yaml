  - question: How does Actian 4GL in OpenROAD represent class objects?
    answer: |
      Actian 4GL in OpenROAD uses XML to represent class objects, which can be directly converted to C#.

  - question: What is the purpose of the 'class comp' declaration in the C# example?
    answer: |
      The 'class comp' declaration creates a new class named comp, which is used to encapsulate data and behavior
      related to a specific entity within a software system.

  - question: "What does ': superClass' indicate in the class declaration?"
    answer: |
      ': superClass' specifies that the comp class inherits from (extends) another class named superClass. This
      allows comp to inherit properties and behaviors from superClass, promoting code reuse and establishing an
      "is-a" relationship.

  - question: What are the field declarations in the comp class?
    answer: |
      The field declarations in the comp class are:
      - int i_no;
      - char i_f_no;
      - string v_f_name;
      - int i_st;
      These declare four private fields within the comp class.

  - question: What is the purpose of fields in a class?
    answer: |
      Fields are variables that store data associated with an object of the class. They define the state or
      characteristics of instances of the class.

  - question: What are the types of fields used in the comp class?
    answer: |
      The comp class uses the following field types:
      - int (integer) for i_no and i_st
      - char (character) for i_f_no
      - string for v_f_name

  - question: What do the fields in the comp class represent?
    answer: |
      The fields in the comp class represent specific attributes or properties (i_no, i_f_no, v_f_name, i_st) that
      instances of comp will possess.

  - question: How does inheritance benefit the comp class?
    answer: |
      Inheritance allows the comp class to inherit properties and behaviors from superClass, promoting code reuse
      and establishing an "is-a" relationship between comp and superClass.

  - question: What is the relationship between XML and C# in Actian 4GL for OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      In Actian 4GL for OpenROAD, XML is used to represent class objects, which can then be directly converted to C#
      representations.

  - question: Why are fields declared as private in the comp class?
    answer: |
      Fields are declared as private in the comp class to encapsulate the data and prevent direct access from outside
      the class. This promotes data hiding and helps maintain the integrity of the object's state.
