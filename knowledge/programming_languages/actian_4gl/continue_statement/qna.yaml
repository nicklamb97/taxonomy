  Actian 4GL.

seed_examples:
  - question: What is the purpose of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement?
    answer: An Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement skips the remainder of a loop
      iteration and then continues processing the next iteration of the loop.
  - question: What is the basic syntax of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement?
    answer: 'The basic syntax is: continue [label];'
  - question: In which types of loops can the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement
      be used?
    answer: The Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement can be used in for, select, and
      while loops.
  - question: What is the purpose of the 'label' parameter in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      Continue Statement?
    answer: The 'label' parameter in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement specifies
      the loop that you want to continue using, allowing control of nested loops.
  - question: What happens if no label is specified in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue
      Statement?
    answer: If no label is specified in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement, OpenROAD
      continues with the innermost loop.
  - question: Can keywords be used as labels in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement?
    answer: No, labels in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement must be character
      strings without quotation marks and cannot be keywords.
  - question: How can the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement be used to process
      only changed rows in a loop?
    answer: The Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement can be used to skip iterations
      where the row state is not changed, allowing processing of only changed rows.
  - question: How does the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement work in nested loops?
    answer: In nested loops, the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement can use labels
      to specify which loop to continue, allowing control over inner or outer loop continuation.
  - question: What is the difference between using a labeled and unlabeled Continue
      Statement in nested loops?
    answer: A labeled Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement allows specifying which
      loop to continue, while an unlabeled one always continues the innermost loop.
  - question: Can the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement be used outside of a loop?
    answer: No, the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement is specifically designed
      for use within loops (for, select, and while loops).
