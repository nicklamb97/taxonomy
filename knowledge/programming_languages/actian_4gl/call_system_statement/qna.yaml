created_by: willsjames
domain: actian_4gl
seed_examples:
  - question: What is the purpose of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Call System Statement?
    answer: An Actian 4GL OpenROAD Call System Statement is used to call the operating
      system from an application.
  - question: What is the basic syntax of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Call System Statement?
    answer: 'The basic syntax is: call system [systemcommand];'
  - question: How does execution resume after an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Call System Statement?
    answer: Execution resumes with the statement immediately following the call system
      statement when control returns to the application.
  - question: Can an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Call System Statement return status information?
    answer: Yes, the Call System Statement can return status information to the application
      through the SessionObject class attribute CallSystemStatus Attribute.
  - question: What happens if no system command is specified in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      Call System Statement?
    answer: If no system command is specified and CurSession.ProcessWindow=TRUE, the
      statement puts the user at the operating system prompt.
  - question: How does the CurSession.ProcessWait attribute affect the Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      Call System Statement?
    answer: If CurSession.ProcessWait=FALSE, the statement returns immediately after
      starting the command. If TRUE, it waits until the command has finished.
  - question: Can direct communication occur between an OpenROAD application and an
      application called via Call System Statement?
    answer: No, there is no direct communication method. Indirect communication can
      be achieved through file writing or database operations.
  - question: What is a more efficient way to start a new OpenROAD application than
      using Call System Statement?
    answer: Using the call runimage statement is more efficient for starting a new OpenROAD
      application.
  - question: What does the systemcommand parameter in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Call System
      Statement specify?
    answer: The systemcommand parameter specifies a string expression that must evaluate
      to a single operating system command.
  - question: How can a user return to the application after being put at the operating
      system prompt by a Call System Statement?
    answer: The user can return to the application by entering the exit command at the
      operating system prompt.
