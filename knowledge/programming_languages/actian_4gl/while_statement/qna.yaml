  - question: What is the purpose of the while statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The while statement in Actian 4GL creates loops that execute a block of code repeatedly
      as long as a specified condition remains true.
  - question: What is the syntax of the while statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the while statement is:
      ```4gl
      while condition do
          -- statements to execute
      endwhile;
      ```
      'condition' is a logical expression evaluated before each loop iteration.
  - question: How can the while statement be used for early exit in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      Actian 4GL provides the endloop statement to exit the while loop prematurely based on
      internal conditions, enhancing control over program flow.
  - question: Can you provide a basic example of a while loop in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      Here's a basic example:
      ```4gl
      define i integer = 1;

      while i <= 3 do
          MESSAGE i;
          let i = i + 1;
      endwhile;
      ```
      This prints numbers 1 to 3 sequentially.
  - question: How does Actian 4GL handle conditions within a while loop?
    answer: |
      Actian 4GL evaluates the specified condition before each iteration. If true, the loop
      continues executing; otherwise, it terminates.
  - question: What role does the endloop statement play in Actian 4GL's while loop?
    answer: |
      The endloop statement allows developers to exit the while loop prematurely based on
      specific conditions within the loop, optimizing program control.
  - question: What are scenarios where developers use while loops in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      While loops in Actian 4GL are utilized for tasks requiring repetitive execution until
      certain conditions are met, such as data processing and iterative calculations.
  - question: How does Actian 4GL handle variable updates within a while loop?
    answer: |
      Actian 4GL supports variable updates within while loops using assignment operations
      like `let` to modify loop control variables between iterations.
  - question: Can while loops in Actian 4GL iterate over arrays or collections?
    answer: |
      Actian 4GL while loops primarily iterate based on logical conditions rather than
      direct array or collection traversal, focusing on conditional repetition.
  - question: What advantages do while loops offer in Actian 4GL programming?
    answer: |
      While loops provide Actian 4GL developers with flexible iterative control, enabling
      efficient handling of repetitive tasks and conditional processing.
  - question: How does Actian 4GL handle nested while loops?
    answer: |
      Actian 4GL supports nested while loops, allowing developers to create complex
      control structures for iterative processing within hierarchical data scenarios.
