seed_examples:
  - question: What is the purpose of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Case Statement?
    answer: An Actian 4GL OpenROAD Case Statement selects one of a number of possible
      actions based on the value of an expression.
  - question: What is the basic syntax of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Case Statement?
    answer: 'The basic syntax is: case key of valuelist: statement | beginendblock {valuelist:
      statement | beginendblock} endcase;'
  - question: What types of expressions can be used as the key in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      Case Statement?
    answer: The key in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Case Statement can be any valid OpenROAD
      data type, including integers, floating point, or string values.
  - question: How does the 'nextcase' statement relate to the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Case
      Statement?
    answer: The 'nextcase' statement is used to jump from the current statement to the
      beginning of the next statement block in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Case Statement,
      similar to a fall-through case in C.
  - question: How are empty strings evaluated in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Case Statements
      compared to SQL statements?
    answer: In Actian 4GL OpenROAD Case Statements, '' and ' ' are not evaluated equally,
      unlike in SQL statements where they are treated the same.
  - question: Can the valuelist in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Case Statement contain multiple
      expressions?
    answer: Yes, the valuelist in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Case Statement can specify
      a single expression or a list of expressions of the same type as the key expression,
      separated by commas.
  - question: How is the 'default' case handled in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Case Statement?
    answer: The 'default' case can be included as a valuelist option in an Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD Case Statement. There can only be one default statement block, and it
      doesn't have to be at the end.
  - question: Can Actian 4GL OpenROAD Case Statements be used for object class comparisons?
    answer: Yes, Actian 4GL OpenROAD Case Statements can be used efficiently for comparing
      object classes by using the object's Class attribute.
  - question: Is it necessary to use 'begin' and 'end' for every case in an Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD Case Statement?
    answer: No, if only a single statement is necessary for a case, 'begin' and 'end'
      are not required, allowing for briefer code.
  - question: How does an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Case Statement compare to an if-elseif
      structure for class comparisons?
    answer: An Actian 4GL OpenROAD Case Statement can provide cleaner and faster execution
      for class comparisons compared to an if-elseif structure, especially when using
      the object's Class attribute.
