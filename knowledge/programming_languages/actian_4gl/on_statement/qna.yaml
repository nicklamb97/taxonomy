seed_examples:
  - question: What is the purpose of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD On Statement?
    answer: An Actian 4GL OpenROAD On Statement specifies an event block for one or
      more events.
  - question: What is the basic syntax of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD On Statement?
    answer: 'The basic syntax is: on eventtype [fieldname] | [''eventname''] [(parameterlist)]
      = [declareblock] beginendblock[;]'
  - question: When should you include a value for 'eventname' in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      On Statement?
    answer: Include 'eventname' only if the event type is userevent, extclassevent,
      or dbevent.
  - question: What happens if you don't specify an event name in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      On Statement?
    answer: OpenROAD executes the block whenever the frame receives any user event or
      database event, respectively.
  - question: What does the 'fieldname' parameter specify in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      On Statement?
    answer: It specifies the name of the field or menu item that triggers the event.
  - question: Can you use the field function with the field or menu item name in an
      Actian 4GL OpenROAD On Statement?
    answer: No, you should not use the field function with the field or menu item name.
  - question: What is the purpose of the 'parameterlist' in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD On
      Statement?
    answer: It defines parameters for the event, which can be specified on a SendUserEvent
      method invocation.
  - question: How can you send user-named parameters with userevents in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: You can specify user-named parameters as arguments to the SendUserEvent
      method defined for the GhostExec class.
  - question: What happens if there's a data type mismatch in parameter passing in Actian
      4GL OpenROAD On Statements?
    answer: It's flagged with an error at runtime when the event recipient's activation
      block is activated, not by the compiler.
  - question: Can you provide an example of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD On Statement?
    answer: 'Example: on click return_button = begin return; end'
