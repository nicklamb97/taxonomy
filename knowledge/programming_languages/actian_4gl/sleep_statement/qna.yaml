  - question: What is the purpose of the sleep statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The sleep statement in Actian 4GL pauses program execution for a specified duration, creating timed delays
      or pauses in applications.
  - question: What is the syntax of the sleep statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The syntax for the sleep statement is:
      ```4gl
      sleep duration;
      ```
      Where 'duration' specifies the time to sleep in seconds as an integer literal or variable.
  - question: How can the sleep statement be used in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      Developers use the sleep statement to introduce delays in program execution, useful for timed actions or
      creating pauses before proceeding with further operations.
  - question: What are some basic examples of using the sleep statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      Here's a basic example:
      ```4gl
      i = 1;
      WHILE i <= 3 DO
          MESSAGE i;
          let i = i + 1;
          sleep 2;
      ENDWHILE;
      ```
      This prints numbers 1 to 3 with a 2-second pause between each.
  - question: How does Actian 4GL handle the sleep duration parameter?
    answer: |
      Actian 4GL expects the sleep duration to be specified in whole seconds. It supports using variables or literal
      integers to define the sleep period.
  - question: Can the sleep statement be used to pause after user input in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      Yes, developers can use the sleep statement to introduce pauses before or after user interactions. For example:
      ```4gl
      user_input = 10;
      IF user_input > 10 then
          MESSAGE "Input is greater than 10.";
      ELSE
          MESSAGE "Input is less than or equal to 10.";
      ENDIF;
      sleep 3;
      MESSAGE "End of program.";
      ```
      This waits for 3 seconds before displaying "End of program."
  - question: What considerations should developers keep in mind when using the sleep statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      Developers should note that the sleep duration must be an integer and that the sleep operation blocks program
      execution during the specified time period.
  - question: How does Actian 4GL's sleep statement compare to similar functionalities in other programming languages?
    answer: |
      Actian 4GL's sleep statement functions similarly to sleep or delay statements in other languages, providing a
      straightforward way to introduce pauses in program flow for specified durations.
  - question: Can you use variables to define the sleep duration in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      Yes, Actian 4GL allows developers to use variables to dynamically define the duration for which the program
      should sleep, enhancing flexibility in application design.
  - question: In what scenarios would a developer use the sleep statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      Developers use the sleep statement in Actian 4GL to synchronize actions, control pacing in animations or
      timed processes, and manage user interaction timing within applications.
  - question: How does Actian 4GL handle blocking during the sleep period?
    answer: |
      Actian 4GL's sleep statement performs a blocking operation, pausing the entire program execution until the
      specified sleep duration elapses.
