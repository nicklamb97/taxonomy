  - question: What is a Statement List in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?
    answer: A Statement List specifies a list of any legal OpenROAD statements. It allows
      the use of any legal 4GL statements separated by semicolons.
  - question: What is the basic syntax of a Statement List?
    answer: 'The basic syntax is: {statement}'
  - question: What does 'statement' represent in the Statement List syntax?
    answer: '''statement'' represents any valid 4GL statement, with some exceptions.
      It allows for multiple statements to be grouped together.'
  - question: Are there any statements that cannot be used in a Statement List?
    answer: 'Yes, there are four statements that cannot be used in a Statement List:
      Initialize, Method, On, and Procedure.'
  - question: How are multiple statements separated in a Statement List?
    answer: Multiple statements in a Statement List are separated by semicolons.
  - question: Can you nest Statement Lists within each other?
    answer: The syntax doesn't explicitly forbid nesting, but it's important to note
      that certain statements (Initialize, Method, On, Procedure) are not allowed within
      a Statement List.
  - question: What is the purpose of using a Statement List in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?
    answer: A Statement List allows developers to group multiple 4GL statements together,
      which can be useful for organizing code, creating code blocks, or defining a series
      of actions to be executed together.
  - question: How does a Statement List differ from a regular sequence of statements
      in a program?
    answer: A Statement List is specifically defined as a syntactic element in OpenROAD
      Actian 4GL, while a regular sequence of statements is just a part of the normal
      flow of a program. The Statement List has specific rules about what can be included.
  - question: Is there a limit to the number of statements that can be included in a
      Statement List?
    answer: The syntax doesn't specify a limit to the number of statements. You can
      include multiple statements, each separated by a semicolon.
  - question: How might a Statement List be used in practice in OpenROAD Actian 4GL
      development?
    answer: A Statement List might be used to define a block of code to be executed
      in a specific context, such as in response to an event, as part of a loop, or
      as the body of a custom function or procedure.
