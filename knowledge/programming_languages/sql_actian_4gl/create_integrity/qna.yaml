  - question: What is the purpose of the create integrity statement?
    answer: |
      The create integrity statement in Ingres databases defines an integrity
      constraint on a specified base table. It ensures that data modifications
      adhere to the defined search condition, maintaining data consistency and
      reliability within the database.
  - question: What is the syntax of the create integrity statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the create integrity statement is:
      ```
      create integrity on table_name [corr_name] is search_condition;
      ```
      Here, `table_name` specifies the table for which the integrity
      constraint is defined, `corr_name` is an optional correlation name for
      the table, and `search_condition` defines the constraint condition that
      must be satisfied for all rows in the table.
  - question: What are the parameters available for the create integrity statement?
    answer: |
      Parameters include `table_name`, `corr_name`, and `search_condition`.
      These define the table, optional correlation name, and the condition that
      ensures data integrity by restricting updates that violate the defined
      constraint.
  - question: What permissions are required to execute the create integrity statement?
    answer: |
      To execute the create integrity statement, the user must own the table
      on which the integrity constraint is being defined. This permission
      ensures that only authorized users can define and enforce data integrity
      rules.
  - question: How does the create integrity statement affect database locking?
    answer: |
      Creating an integrity constraint with the create integrity statement
      takes an exclusive lock on the specified table. This exclusive lock
      prevents other sessions from modifying the table concurrently, ensuring
      the integrity constraint is correctly applied during the constraint
      definition.
  - question: What are some related statements to the create integrity statement?
    answer: |
      Related statements include:
      - Drop Integrity Statement: Used to remove an existing integrity
        constraint from a table.
      - Modify Statement: Used to alter existing integrity constraints.
      - Create Table Statement: Used to create new tables with initial
        integrity constraints.
