  - question: What is the purpose of the alter group statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The alter group statement modifies the list of users associated with a group identifier. Individual users
      can be added or dropped, or the entire list can be dropped.
  - question: What is the syntax of the alter group statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The syntax for the alter group statement is:
      ```4gl
      alter group group_id {, group_id}
      add users (user_id {, user_id}) | drop users (user_id {, user_id}) | drop all;
      ```
  - question: Can you add and drop users in the same alter group statement?
    answer: |
      No, an add and a drop operation cannot be performed in the same alter group statement.
  - question: What happens if a non-existent group_id is specified in an alter group statement?
    answer: |
      If a non-existent group_id is specified, a warning is issued and processing continues with the next valid
      group_id in the list.
  - question: What are the requirements for adding users to a group in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The user_ids must exist to be added to a group. If a specified user_id does not exist, an error is issued
      and processing continues with the remaining user_ids. Additional occurrences of the same user_id in the
      list are ignored.
  - question: What happens if a user_id is not in the group user list when dropping users?
    answer: |
      If a specified user_id is not in the group user list, an error is issued and processing continues with the
      remaining user_ids.
  - question: Can a user be dropped from their default group in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      No, a user cannot be dropped from a group if that group is the default group of the user. Use the alter user
      statement to change a user's default group.
  - question: What happens if a user is dropped from a group during an active session?
    answer: |
      If a user is dropped from a group in a session associated with that group, the user retains the privileges
      of the group until the session terminates.
  - question: What permissions are required to execute the alter group statement?
    answer: |
      The maintain_users privilege is required to execute the alter group statement.
  - question: How does the alter group statement affect the iiusergroup catalog?
    answer: |
      The alter group statement locks pages in the iiusergroup catalog in the iidbdb. This causes sessions
      attempting to connect to the server to be suspended until the alter group statement is completed.
