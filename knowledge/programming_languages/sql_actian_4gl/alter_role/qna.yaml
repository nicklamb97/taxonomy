  - question: What is the syntax of the alter role statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The syntax for the alter role statement is:
      ```4gl
      alter role role_id {, role_id}
      [with with_option {, with_option}];
      ```
  - question: What does the role_id parameter specify in the alter role statement?
    answer: |
      The role_id parameter specifies an existing role ID created with the create role statement. If any specified
      role identifiers do not exist, the DBMS Server issues a warning, but all valid role identifiers are processed.
  - question: What is the role_password parameter used for in the alter role statement?
    answer: |
      The role_password parameter defines the password for the role. If no password is specified, any session has
      access to the specified role identifier and its associated permissions.
  - question: What options can be specified with the with_option parameter in the alter role statement?
    answer: |
      The with_option parameter specifies one of the following password options:
      - nopassword
      - password = 'role_password'
  - question: What permissions are required to execute the alter role statement?
    answer: |
      You must have maintain_users privilege and be connected to the iidbdb database. Additionally, you must have
      maintain_audit privilege to change security audit attributes.
  - question: How does the alter role statement affect the iirole catalog?
    answer: |
      The alter role statement locks pages in the iirole catalog of the iidbdb. This can cause sessions attempting to
      connect to the server to suspend until the statement is completed.
  - question: What happens if a specified role identifier does not exist in an alter role statement?
    answer: |
      If one or more specified role identifiers do not exist, the DBMS Server issues a warning, but all valid role
      identifiers are processed.
  - question: What related statements should be known in context with the alter role statement?
    answer: |
      Related statements include:
      - Create Role Statement
      - Drop Role Statement
  - question: Can you provide an example of changing the password for a role identifier?
    answer: |
      Sure, here's an example:
      ```4gl
      alter role new_accounts with
          password = 'eggbasket';
      ```
  - question: Can you provide an example of removing the password for a role identifier?
    answer: |
      Sure, here's an example:
      ```4gl
      alter role chk_inventory with nopassword;
      ```
