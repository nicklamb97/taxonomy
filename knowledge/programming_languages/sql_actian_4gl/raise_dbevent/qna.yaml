  - question: What is the syntax of the raise dbevent statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the raise dbevent statement is as follows:
      ```
      raise dbevent [schema.]event_name [event_text]
                    [with [no]share];
      ```

  - question: What does the raise dbevent statement do?
    answer: |
      The raise dbevent statement enables an application to notify other applications
      of its status. It allows a session to communicate status information to other
      sessions that are registered to receive the specified event_name.

  - question: What are the parameters of the raise dbevent statement?
    answer: |
      The raise dbevent statement has the following parameters:
      - event_name: Specifies an existing database event name.
      - event_text: Specifies a string (maximum 256 characters) to be sent to
        receiving applications.

  - question: How can receiving applications obtain the event_text?
    answer: |
      To obtain the event_text, receiving applications must use the
      inquire_sql(variable = MESSAGETEXT) statement.

  - question: What happens if the schema is omitted in the raise dbevent statement?
    answer: |
      If schema is omitted, the DBMS Server checks first for the specified database
      event owned by the effective user of the session. If the current effective user
      does not own the database event, the DBMS Server seeks the specified database
      event in the database events owned by the DBA.

  - question: How can you restrict database event notification to the session that raised the event?
    answer: |
      To restrict database event notification to the session that raised the
      database event, specify "with noshare" in the raise dbevent statement.

  - question: What is the default behavior for notifying sessions about a raised event?
    answer: |
      The default behavior is to notify all registered sessions. This can be
      explicitly specified with "with share" or by omitting the share clause.

  - question: What happens if a database event is raised within a transaction that is subsequently rolled back?
    answer: |
      If a database event is raised from within a transaction and the transaction
      is subsequently rolled back, the database event notification is not rolled back.

  - question: What permissions are required to raise a database event you do not own?
    answer: |
      To raise a database event you do not own, you must:
      1. Specify the schema parameter
      2. Have RAISE privilege for the database event

  - question: How can you assign RAISE privilege to another user?
    answer: |
      To assign RAISE privilege to another user, use the grant statement.
      Refer to the Grant (privilege) Statement for more information.

  - question: What are some related statements to the raise dbevent statement?
