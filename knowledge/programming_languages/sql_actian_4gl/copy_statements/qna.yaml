  - question: What is the purpose of Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements?
    answer: |
      Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements are used for importing data from external files into Actian databases or exporting
      data from Actian databases to external files. They streamline data transfer processes and ensure data integrity
      across different environments.
  - question: How do you specify the direction of data transfer in Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements?
    answer: |
      In Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements, the direction of data transfer is specified using keywords:
      - `FROM` for importing data into Actian databases from external files.
      - `TO` for exporting data from Actian databases to external files.
  - question: What are the key components of an Actian 4GL SQL COPY statement?
    answer: |
      An Actian 4GL SQL COPY statement consists of:
      - The `COPY` keyword to initiate the statement.
      - Optional keywords such as `FROM` or `TO` to indicate the direction of data transfer.
      - Table or file names specifying the source or destination of data.
      - Optional clauses like `USING` to specify file formats or delimiters.
  - question: How do you import data from an external file using Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements?
    answer: |
      To import data from an external file into an Actian database, use the following syntax:
      ```
      COPY table_name FROM 'external_file_path' [USING options];
      ```
      Replace `table_name` with the name of the Actian database table and `external_file_path` with the path to the
      external file containing data to be imported. `USING options` is optional and specifies additional parameters
      like file formats or delimiters.
  - question: How do you export data from an Actian database to an external file using Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements?
    answer: |
      To export data from an Actian database to an external file, use the following syntax:
      ```
      COPY table_name TO 'external_file_path' [USING options];
      ```
      Replace `table_name` with the name of the database table from which data is exported and `external_file_path`
      with the path to the external file where data will be exported. `USING options` is optional and can include file
      format specifications or delimiters.
  - question: What file formats are supported in Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements?
    answer: |
      Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements support various file formats for data import and export operations, including:
      - Delimited text files (e.g., CSV, TSV) using delimiters such as commas or tabs.
      - Fixed-width text files where data fields are aligned based on predefined column widths.
      - Actian database-specific formats optimized for efficient data transfer and storage.
  - question: How do Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements handle data format conversions?
    answer: |
      Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements automatically handle data format conversions between external files and Actian
      database tables. This ensures compatibility and data integrity during import and export operations.
  - question: Can Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements handle large volumes of data efficiently?
    answer: |
      Yes, Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements are designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently, optimizing
      performance during data import and export processes across Actian database environments.
  - question: What are delimiters in Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements?
    answer: |
      Delimiters in Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements are characters that separate fields and mark the end of records
      in data files. They include characters like newline (`nl`), tab (`tab`), space (`sp`), comma (`comma`), and more.
      Delimiters are specified to parse data correctly during import or export operations.
  - question: How do CSV and SSV delimiters differ in Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements?
    answer: |
      CSV (Comma Separated Values) and SSV (Semicolon Separated Values) delimiters in Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements
      are used to handle specific formats of data files. CSV uses commas to separate values, with special handling for
      quoted fields containing commas. SSV uses semicolons for separation, following similar rules as CSV.
  - question: What considerations are important when choosing delimiters in Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements?
    answer: |
      When choosing delimiters for Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements, it's crucial to avoid characters that may appear
      in data or padding within files. Incorrect delimiter selection can lead to parsing errors or data corruption.
  - question: How does the `WITH NULL` clause work in Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements?
    answer: |
      The `WITH NULL` clause in Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements allows specifying how null values are handled during
      data import or export. It can define marker values for nulls in data files or specify values to be written as null
      in database columns, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
