  - question: What is the syntax of the non-cursor delete statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the non-cursor delete statement is:
      ```
      delete from tablename [corrname]
           [where searchcondition];
      ```
      If the where clause is omitted, all rows in the table are deleted.

  - question: How does the repeated option enhance performance in delete statements?
    answer: |
      The repeated keyword in delete statements for Ingres encodes and saves the
      query execution plan, improving performance for repeated executions of the
      statement.

  - question: What is the purpose of the cursor version of the delete statement?
    answer: |
      The cursor version of the delete statement deletes the row currently pointed
      to by the specified cursor_variable. It operates on one row at a time.

  - question: What must be done before issuing a cursor delete statement in Ingres?
    answer: |
      Before issuing a cursor delete statement, you must open the cursor, fetch a
      row, and ensure the delete operation occurs within the same DBMS session.

  - question: How does Ingres handle the state of the cursor after a successful cursor delete?
    answer: |
      After a successful cursor delete in Ingres, the State attribute of the
      CursorObject is set to CS_NOCURRENT, indicating the cursor points after the
      deleted row but before the next row.

  - question: What parameters can be used in the delete statement in Ingres?
    answer: |
      The delete statement in Ingres supports the following parameters:
      - tablename: Specifies the table from which rows are deleted.
      - corrname: Correlation name used in the non-cursor version.
      - searchcondition: Logical expression specifying rows to delete.
      - cursor_variable: Reference variable pointing to the CursorObject in the
        cursor version.
