  - question: What is the syntax of the grant (privilege) statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the grant (privilege) statement in Ingres is as follows:
      ```
      grant all [privileges] | privilege {, privilege}
            [on [object_type] [schema.]object_name {, [schema.]object_name}]
            to public | [auth_type]auth_id{, auth_id};
      ```
  - question: What does the grant (privilege) statement do?
    answer: |
      The grant (privilege) statement grants privileges on the database as a whole or on individual tables, views,
      sequences, or procedures. It controls access to database objects, roles, and DBMS resources.
  - question: How do you remove privileges granted by the grant statement?
    answer: |
      To remove privileges, use the revoke statement. To determine the privileges in effect for a session, use the
      DBMSINFO function.
  - question: What is the ISO/ANSI-compliant method for controlling access to database objects and resources?
    answer: |
      The grant statement is the ISO/ANSI-compliant method for controlling access to database objects and resources.
  - question: How can you display granted database privileges?
    answer: |
      To display granted database privileges, select data from the iidbprivileges system catalog.
  - question: What are the valid object types for the grant statement?
    answer: |
      Valid object types for the grant statement are:
      - table (default)
      - database
      - procedure
      - dbevent
      - current installation
  - question: What are the valid auth_types for the grant statement?
    answer: |
      Valid auth_types for the grant statement are:
      - user
      - group
      - role
      Default: user
  - question: What happens if you specify public as the auth_type?
    answer: |
      Specifying public grants a privilege to all users. The auth_type parameter can be omitted.
  - question: Can privileges be granted out of order in the grant statement?
    answer: |
      Privileges cannot be defined for more than one type of object in a single grant statement. The object_type must
      agree with the privilege being granted.
  - question: What happens if there's a mismatch in variable data types during grant?
    answer: |
      OpenROAD reports a mismatch in the iierrornumber system variable if there's a mismatch in data types, though the
      row is still fetched and becomes the current row.
  - question: Can you provide an example of granting select and update privileges on a table?
    answer: |
      ```
      grant select, update on table salary to group acct_clerk;
      ```
  - question: Can you provide an example of granting update privileges on specific columns in a table?
    answer: |
      ```
      grant update(empname, empaddress) on table employee to joank, gerryr;
      ```
  - question: Can you provide an example of granting execute privileges on a procedure?
    answer: |
      ```
      grant execute on procedure monthly_report to public;
      ```
  - question: Can you provide an example of granting noquery_row_limit on a database?
    answer: |
      ```
      grant noquery_row_limit on database new_acct to role update_emp;
      ```
  - question: Can you provide an example of granting register and raise privileges on a database event?
    answer: |
      ```
      grant register, raise on dbevent stock_low to role inventory_monitor;
      ```
