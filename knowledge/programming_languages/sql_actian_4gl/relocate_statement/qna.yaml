  - question: What is the syntax of the relocate statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the relocate statement is as follows:
      ```
      relocate table_name to location_name;
      ```

  - question: What does the relocate statement do?
    answer: |
      The relocate statement is used to move a table from its current location to
      the area corresponding to the specified location_name. All indexes, views,
      and protections for the table remain in force and valid regardless of the
      new location of the table.

  - question: When should the relocate statement be used?
    answer: |
      The relocate statement must be used when the current disk of the table
      becomes too full.

  - question: What are the parameters of the relocate statement?
    answer: |
      The relocate statement has two parameters:
      - table_name: Specifies the name of the table to be relocated.
      - location_name: Refers to the area in which the new table is created.

  - question: What are the requirements for the location_name parameter?
    answer: |
      The location_name must meet two requirements:
      1. It must be defined on the system.
      2. The database must have been extended to the corresponding area.

  - question: Can host language variables be used in the relocate statement?
    answer: |
      No, table_name and location_name must be string constants if this statement
      is used in an embedded program. Host language variables cannot be used to
      represent either.

  - question: What happens to the table's indexes, views, and protections after relocation?
    answer: |
      All indexes, views, and protections for the table remain in force and valid
      regardless of the new location of the table.

  - question: Is there any limit to how many times a table can be relocated?
    answer: |
      The documentation does not specify any limit to the number of times a table
      can be relocated.

  - question: Does the relocate statement affect the structure or content of the table?
    answer: |
      No, the relocate statement only moves the table to a new location. It does
      not affect the structure or content of the table.

  - question: Can you provide an example of using the relocate statement?
    answer: |
      Here's an example of using the relocate statement:
      ```sql
      relocate employee to remote_loc;
      ```
      This statement relocates the employee table to the area defined by the
      remote_loc location_name.
