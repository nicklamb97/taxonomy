  - question: What is the syntax of the direct execute immediate statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the direct execute immediate statement is:
      ```
      direct execute immediate string | string_variable;
      ```
      This statement sends DBMS-specific commands to the DBMS without translation.

  - question: What is the purpose of the direct execute immediate statement?
    answer: |
      The direct execute immediate statement allows sending DBMS-specific commands
      directly to the connected DBMS or Enterprise Access product. It bypasses
      translation and is useful for executing commands that are not natively
      supported by the DBMS.

  - question: How does the direct execute immediate statement handle string literals?
    answer: |
      You can specify the statement using either a string literal or a host language
      variable. If using a string literal, avoid embedding quotes within the literal
      to adhere to OpenSQL string-delimiting conventions.

  - question: Can the direct execute immediate statement be used to return rows?
    answer: |
      No, the direct execute immediate statement cannot be used to return rows to a
      session. It is specifically designed for executing commands that do not involve
      returning result sets.

  - question: What are some examples of commands suitable for the direct execute immediate statement?
    answer: |
      Commands suitable for direct execute immediate include:
      - Setting database parameters.
      - Executing DDL statements like create, alter, and drop.
      - Managing system-level configurations not accessible via standard SQL.

  - question: What are the potential security implications of using direct execute immediate statements?
    answer: |
      Using direct execute immediate statements requires careful consideration of
      security implications. Improperly constructed statements or insufficient
      validation can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities or unintended data loss.
