  - question: What is the syntax of the execute procedure statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the execute procedure statement in Ingres is as follows:
      ```
      [variable =] execute procedure procname
                ([parameterlist])
                [into cursorobjreference{, cursorobjreference}];
      ```
  - question: What does the execute procedure statement do?
    answer: |
      The execute procedure statement executes a database procedure that must be
      registered before the statement calls it.
  - question: Does the procedure need to be registered within the application issuing the execute procedure statement?
    answer: |
      No, registration of the procedure does not need to occur within the issuing
      application.
  - question: How can you pass values to the procedure using the execute procedure statement?
    answer: |
      You can pass values using the optional parameter list. The data type of each
      value must be compatible with the parameter.
  - question: What is the purpose of the into clause in the execute procedure statement?
    answer: |
      The into clause allows database procedures to return data sets. Note that
      this clause is currently not available when running against the Ingres DBMS.
  - question: What permissions are required to execute a procedure that you do not own?
    answer: |
      To execute a procedure that you do not own, you need EXECUTE privilege for
      the procedure and must specify the schema parameter.
  - question: What locking behavior does the execute procedure statement exhibit?
    answer: |
      The locks taken by the procedure depend on the statements executed inside it.
      All locks are taken immediately when the procedure is executed.
  - question: What data type must the variable be if the procedure returns a single value?
    answer: |
      If the procedure returns a single value, the variable that receives the return
      value must be of integer data type.
  - question: Can the execute procedure statement return data sets?
    answer: |
      Yes, the execute procedure statement can return data sets using the into clause,
      but this functionality is not available when running against the Ingres DBMS.
  - question: What other SQL statements are related to the execute procedure statement?
    answer: |
      The execute procedure statement is related to the Grant (privilege) Statement.
  - question: Can you provide an example of executing a procedure using the execute procedure statement?
    answer: |
      Assume the following database procedure definition:
      ```
      create procedure myproc
                (emp_name = varchar(256) not null, emp_no = integer not null,
                 emp_terminated = integer not null) =
      begin
                processing statements
      end
      ```
      Then execute the procedure myproc:
      ```
      execute procedure myproc(emp_name = 'joshw',
                emp_no = 12, emp_terminated = byref(EmpIsTerminated));
      ```
