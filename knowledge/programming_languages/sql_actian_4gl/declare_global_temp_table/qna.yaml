    answer: |
      Temporary tables in Ingres have several restrictions:
      - They cannot be used within database procedures or view definitions.
      - Constraints, integrities, and user-defined defaults (except for not null
        and not default) are not supported.
      - Certain SQL statements like create index and create view cannot be applied
        to temporary tables.

      The with check option clause prevents updates to a temporary table that would

      data integrity during updates.
