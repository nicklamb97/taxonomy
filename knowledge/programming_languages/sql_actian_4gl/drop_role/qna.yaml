  - question: What is the syntax of the drop role statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the drop role statement in Ingres is as follows:
      ```
      drop role role_id {, role_id};
      ```
  - question: What does the drop role statement do?
    answer: |
      The drop role statement removes the specified role identifiers from the installation. Sessions using a role
      identifier when it is dropped continue to run with the privileges defined for that identifier.
  - question: What parameter specifies the role identifier to be dropped?
    answer: |
      The role_id parameter specifies an existing role identifier to be dropped. If any role_ids in the list do not
      exist, the DBMS Server returns an error for each non-existent role_id but does not abort the statement.
  - question: What happens if a role identifier does not exist when using the drop role statement?
    answer: |
      If the list of role_ids contains any that do not exist, the DBMS Server returns an error for each non-existent
      role_id but does not abort the statement. Valid, existing role identifiers in the list are removed.
  - question: What permissions are required to drop role identifiers?
    answer: |
      To drop role identifiers, you must have MAINTAIN_USERS privilege and be connected to the iidbdb database. This
      ensures that only authorized users can remove role identifiers.
  - question: What locking mechanism does the drop role statement use?
    answer: |
      The drop role statement locks pages in the iirole catalog in the iidbdb. This ensures data integrity during the
      operation.
  - question: What related statements should I know about for managing role identifiers?
    answer: |
      Related statements for managing role identifiers include:
      - Create Role Statement
      - Alter Role Statement
  - question: Can you provide an example of dropping a single role identifier using the drop role statement?
    answer: |
      Here is an example of dropping the sales_report role identifier:
      ```
      drop role sales_report;
      ```
