  - question: What is the syntax of the drop integrity statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the drop integrity statement in Ingres is as follows:
      ```
      drop integrity on table_name ALL | integer {, integer};
      ```
  - question: What does the drop integrity statement do?
    answer: |
      The drop integrity statement removes the specified integrity constraints from a table. When integrities are
      dropped, the DBMS Server updates the date and timestamp of the table and recreates query plans for repeat queries
      and database procedures when they are executed.
  - question: Can the drop integrity statement remove constraints defined using the create table statement?
    answer: |
      No, the drop integrity statement does not remove constraints defined using the create table statement.
  - question: What parameter specifies the table from which to drop integrity constraints?
    answer: |
      The table_name parameter specifies the name of the table for which integrity constraints are to be dropped.
  - question: How do you drop all constraints from a table using the drop integrity statement?
    answer: |
      To drop all constraints from a table, use the keyword ALL in the drop integrity statement. For example:
      ```
      drop integrity on exhibitions all;
      ```
  - question: How do you drop individual constraints from a table using the drop integrity statement?
    answer: |
      To drop individual constraints, specify the integer values corresponding to the constraints. For example:
      ```
      drop integrity on job 1, 4, 5;
      ```
  - question: How can you obtain the integer equivalents for integrity constraints?
    answer: |
      To obtain the integer equivalents for integrity constraints, execute the help integrity statement.
  - question: What permissions are required to drop integrity constraints?
    answer: |
      To drop integrity constraints, you must own the table. This ensures only authorized users can remove constraints.
  - question: Can you provide an example of dropping all constraints on a table using the drop integrity statement?
    answer: |
      Here is an example of dropping all constraints on the exhibitions table:
      ```
      drop integrity on exhibitions all;
      ```
  - question: Can you provide an example of dropping specific constraints on a table using the drop integrity statement?
    answer: |
      Here is an example of dropping integrity constraints 1, 4, and 5 on the job table:
      ```
      drop integrity on job 1, 4, 5;
      ```
  - question: What related statements should I know about for managing integrity constraints?
    answer: |
      Related statements for managing integrity constraints include:
      - Create Integrity Statement
