  - question: What is the syntax of the drop rule statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the drop rule statement in Ingres is as follows:
      ```
      drop rule [schema.]rulename;
      ```
  - question: What does the drop rule statement do?
    answer: |
      The drop rule statement removes the specified rule from the database. A rule is automatically dropped if the
      table on which the rule is defined is dropped.
  - question: What parameter specifies the rule to be dropped?
    answer: |
      The rulename parameter specifies the name of the rule to be dropped.
  - question: What permissions are required to drop a rule?
    answer: |
      You must be the owner of a rule to drop it. This ensures that only authorized users can remove rules.
  - question: What happens to a rule if the table on which it is defined is dropped?
    answer: |
      A rule is automatically dropped if the table on which the rule is defined is dropped. This ensures database
      integrity by removing dependent objects.
  - question: Can you provide an example of dropping a rule using the drop rule statement?
    answer: |
      Here is an example of dropping the chk_name rule:
      ```
      drop rule chk_name;
      ```
