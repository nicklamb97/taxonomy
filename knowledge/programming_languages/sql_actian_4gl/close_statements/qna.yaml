  - question: What is the syntax of the close statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the close statement is:
      ```
      close cursor_variable;
      ```
      This statement closes an open cursor in Actian 4GL SQL.

  - question: What happens when you execute the close statement?
    answer: |
      When you execute the close statement, it closes the specified cursor and sets
      the State attribute of the CursorObject to CS_CLOSED. Subsequent attempts to
      use the cursor require reopening it with an open statement.

  - question: When should you use the close statement?
    answer: |
      You should use the close statement to explicitly close a cursor after you have
      finished processing the rows fetched by it. This helps in releasing resources
      and maintaining efficient cursor management.

  - question: What happens to a cursor after it is closed?
    answer: |
      After a cursor is closed using the close statement, it cannot be used for
      further processing unless it is reopened with a new open statement. The
      cursor's state transitions to CS_CLOSED.

  - question: How do commit and rollback statements affect open cursors?
    answer: |
      The commit and rollback statements implicitly close all open cursors. It is
      important to note this behavior to ensure proper cursor management and avoid
      errors due to accessing closed cursors.

  - question: What are the benefits of explicitly closing cursors?
    answer: |
      Explicitly closing cursors with the close statement helps in releasing
      database resources promptly, which can improve application performance and
      reduce the risk of resource leaks.
