  - question: What is the syntax of the create table statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax of the create table statement in Ingres is as follows:
      ```
      create table [schema.] table_name
                    (column_specification {, column_specification})
                    [with with_clause];
      ```

  - question: How does the create table...as select statement work in Ingres?
    answer: |
      The create table...as select statement in Ingres creates a new table
      populated with rows from another table or tables. It has the syntax:
      ```
      create table table_name
                    (column_name {, column_name}) as
                                  subselect
                                  {union [all]
                                  subselect}
                    [with with_clause];
      ```

  - question: What parameters can be used in the with clause of the create table statement?
    answer: |
      The with clause in the create table statement in Ingres supports various
      options such as location, journaling, duplicates, page_size,
      security_audit, autostruct, encryption, and more. These options provide
      flexibility in table creation and management.

  - question: What are the maximum number of columns allowed in a base table in Ingres?
    answer: |
      In Ingres, a base table can have a maximum of 1024 columns.

  - question: How does the page_size option affect table creation in Ingres?
    answer: |
      The page_size option in the create table statement specifies the size of
      data pages for the table, influencing storage efficiency and performance.
      Valid page sizes in Ingres include 2K, 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, and 64K bytes.

  - question: What is the significance of the autostruct option in the with clause of create table?
    answer: |
      The autostruct option in the with clause of the create table statement
      allows Ingres to automatically determine whether to use a B-tree or heap
      storage structure for the table based on the presence of constraint
      definitions. It provides automation in determining the optimal storage
      structure.

  - question: How can encryption be applied to columns in a newly created table using the create table statement?
    answer: |
      Encryption for columns in a newly created table can be specified using
      the encryption option in the with clause. Supported encryption types
      include AES128, AES192, and AES256. The aeskey parameter can be used to
      specify an internal key, or a passphrase can be provided for encryption.

  - question: What is the purpose of the security_audit option in the with clause of create table?
    answer: |
      The security_audit option in the with clause enables auditing for rows or
      tables at either the table level or row level. It helps track operations
      such as insert, delete, update, and select for auditing purposes.

  - question: How can a table be created in multiple physical locations using the create table statement?
    answer: |
      To create a table in multiple physical locations, specify the location
      option in the with clause with a comma-separated list of location names.
      These locations must exist and be extended to corresponding database
      areas.
