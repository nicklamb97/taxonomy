  - question: How to assign a value to a simple scalar variable in Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      Assignment Statement?
    answer: 'To assign a value to a simple scalar variable:

      ```

      service_fee = 5.50;

      ```

      This assigns the value 5.50 to the variable service_fee.'
  - question: Write code to demonstrate assigning values to different types of variables
      in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Assignment Statement.
    answer: 'Here are examples of assigning values to different types of variables:

      ```

      /* Scalar variable */

      name = ''John'';

      empnum = 35;


      /* Reference variable attribute */

      newcustomer.Name = ''Jones'';


      /* Array element */

      client[4].Address = ''4307 Olive St'';

      ```

      These examples show assignments to a scalar variable, a reference variable attribute,
      and an array element.'
  - question: How to assign values to a dynamic array in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Assignment
      Statement?
    answer: 'To assign values to a dynamic array:

      ```

      child[2].name = ''Sally'';

      child[2].age = 8;


      /* Assigning to current row */

      child[].name = ''Steven'';

      child[].age = 11;

      ```

      This code assigns values to specific rows and the current row of a dynamic array.'
  - question: Write code to demonstrate reference variable assignment in Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD Assignment Statement.
    answer: 'Here''s an example of reference variable assignment:

      ```

      /* Assigning one reference variable to another */

      newcustomer = customer;


      /* Assigning a row reference from a dynamic array */

      newcustomer = client[5];


      /* Assigning null to a reference variable */

      newcustomer = null;

      ```

      These examples show different ways to assign reference variables.'
  - question: How to redirect an array variable in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Assignment Statement?
    answer: 'To redirect an array variable:

      ```

      client = old_customers;

      ```

      This statement redirects the array variable ''client'' to point to the same array
      as ''old_customers''.'
  - question: Write code to show how multiple reference variables can point to the same
      object in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Assignment Statement.
    answer: 'Here''s an example of multiple reference variables pointing to the same
      object:

      ```

      address.City = ''New York'';

      address2 = address;

      currcity = address2.City;

      /* currcity is now ''New York'' */

      ```

      This code demonstrates that changes to one reference variable are visible through
      another pointing to the same object.'
  - question: How to handle potential string truncation in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Assignment
      Statement?
    answer: 'To handle potential string truncation:

      ```

      DEFINE short_string VARCHAR(5);

      long_string = ''This is a long string'';

      short_string = long_string;

      /* short_string will contain ''This '' */

      ```

      OpenROAD automatically truncates the string if it''s longer than the variable
      can hold.'
  - question: Write code to demonstrate assigning values of different system classes
      in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Assignment Statement.
    answer: 'Here''s an example of assigning values of different system classes:

      ```

      DEFINE firstfield ActiveField;

      DEFINE surname EntryField;

      firstfield = surname;

      ```

      This is valid because EntryField is a subclass of ActiveField.'
  - question: How to assign values to individual rows of an array in Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      Assignment Statement?
    answer: 'To assign values to individual rows of an array:

      ```

      client[5] = newcustomer;

      ```

      This assigns the value of newcustomer to the 5th row of the client array.'
  - question: Write code to show how assignments affect values displayed in frames in
      Actian 4GL OpenROAD Assignment Statement.
    answer: 'Here''s how assignments affect values displayed in frames:

      ```

      /* Assuming ''customer_name'' is associated with a field in a frame */

      customer_name = ''John Doe'';

      /* The new value will be displayed when the event block completes */

      ```

      The new value will be displayed in the frame when the event block completes or
      the form is refreshed.'
