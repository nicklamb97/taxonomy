  - question: How do you open a new frame named 'customer_details' using the openframe statement?
    answer: "You can open a new frame named 'customer_details' like this:\n```\nopenframe customer_details();\n```"

  - question: What is the purpose of the GhostExec_object in the openframe statement?
    answer: "The GhostExec_object is a reference variable of type GhostExec that stores the GhostExec object of the
    opened frame. It can be used to communicate with the opened frame."

  - question: How can you pass parameters to an opened frame?
    answer: "You can pass parameters to an opened frame like this:\n```\nopenframe customer_details(customer_id =
    1234, show_orders = true);\n```"

  - question: What is the difference between using an actual frame name and a variable in the openframe statement?
    answer: "Using an actual frame name resolves the reference at compile time, while using a variable resolves it at
    runtime. This affects timing of name resolution, especially in included applications."

  - question: How do you set the ParentFrame attribute when opening a frame?
    answer: "You can set the ParentFrame attribute using the withclause:\n```\nopenframe customer_details()
    with ParentFrame = parent_frame_ref;\n```"

  - question: What happens if you assign null to the ParentFrame attribute?
    answer: "If you assign null to the ParentFrame attribute, the called frame runs as a detached frame, independent
    of other frames in the application."

  - question: How can you make an opened frame a child of the current frame?
    answer: "To make an opened frame a child of the current frame, use:\n```\nopenframe child_frame()
    with ParentFrame = CurFrame;\n```"

  - question: What method is used for communication between frames opened with openframe?
    answer: "The SendUserEvent method is used for communication between frames opened with openframe."

  - question: How do you check if a frame reference is not null before sending a user event?
    answer: "Check if a frame reference is not null before sending a user event like this:\n```\nif frame_ref is not
    null then\n    frame_ref.SendUserEvent(eventname 'message');\nendif;\n```"

  - question: Can you nest opened frames in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: "Yes, you can nest opened frames. A called frame can open another frame, creating a nested structure."

  - question: How do you open a frame and store its reference for later use?
    answer: "Open a frame and store its reference like this:\n```\nframe_ref = openframe customer_details();\n```"

  - question: What is the difference between openframe and callframe statements?
    answer: "openframe runs a new frame concurrently with the calling ProcExec, while callframe runs a frame
    sequentially, waiting for it to complete before continuing."

  - question: How can you use a variable to specify the frame name in an openframe statement?
    answer: "Use a variable to specify the frame name like this:\n```\ndeclare frame_name = varchar(30);\nframe_name
    = 'customer_details';\nopenframe $frame_name();\n```"

  - question: What happens if you don't set the ParentFrame attribute in the openframe statement?
    answer: "If you don't set the ParentFrame attribute, the called frame becomes a child of the calling ProcExec by
    default."

  - question: Can the openframe statement be used within an expression?
    answer: "No, the openframe statement cannot be used within an expression. It must be used as a standalone
    statement."
