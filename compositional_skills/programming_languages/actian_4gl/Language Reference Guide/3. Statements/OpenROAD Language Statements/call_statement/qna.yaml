  - question: How to use the basic call statement to invoke Query-By-Forms (QBF) in
      Actian 4GL OpenROAD Call Statement?
    answer: 'To call QBF with no parameters:

      ```

      commit;

      call qbf();

      ```

      This will display the QBF catalog frame.'
  - question: Write code to demonstrate calling Query-By-Forms (QBF) with specific parameters
      in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Call Statement.
    answer: 'Here''s an example of calling QBF with specific parameters:

      ```

      commit;

      call qbf(qbfname = ''expenses'', flags = ''-mappend -s'');

      ```

      This runs QBF in insert mode, suppressing status messages, using the QBFName ''expenses''.'
  - question: How to call a report using the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Call Statement?
    answer: 'To call a report:

      ```

      commit;

      call report(name = ''emptable'', mode = ''column'');

      ```

      This runs a default report on ''emptable'' in column mode.'
  - question: Write code to demonstrate calling an OpenROAD application stored in a
      database using Actian 4GL OpenROAD Call Statement.
    answer: 'Here''s how to call an OpenROAD application stored in a database:

      ```

      call rundbapp(application = ''inventory'', startcomponent = ''parts'');

      ```

      This calls the ''inventory'' application, starting at the ''parts'' frame.'
  - question: How to use flag parameters in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Call Statement?
    answer: 'You can use flag parameters in two ways:

      1. Using keyword synonyms:

      ```

      call qbf(tblfld = ''customer'');

      ```

      2. Using the flags parameter:

      ```

      call qbf(flags = ''-tcustomer'');

      ```

      Both methods call QBF with the -t flag for the ''customer'' table.'
  - question: Write code to demonstrate calling the SQL Terminal Monitor with flags
      in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Call Statement.
    answer: 'To call the SQL Terminal Monitor with flags:

      ```

      call sql(flags = ''+a -d +s'');

      ```

      This calls the SQL Terminal Monitor with the +a, -d, and +s flags.'
  - question: How to call a report with complex parameters in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Call
      Statement?
    answer: 'Here''s an example of calling a report with complex parameters:

      ```

      create table :tbl as select * from orders where status = :status and custno =
      :custno;

      commit;

      call report(name = ''orders'', param = ''table = "'' + :tbl + ''"'');

      ```

      This creates a temporary table and runs a report on it, passing the table name
      as a parameter.'
  - question: Write code to demonstrate calling VIGRAPH in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Call
      Statement.
    answer: 'To call VIGRAPH:

      ```

      call rungraph(graph = ''sales_chart'', device = ''screen'', plevel = 3);

      ```

      This calls VIGRAPH to display the ''sales_chart'' graph on the screen with presentation
      level 3.'
  - question: How to call an OpenROAD application from an image file using Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD Call Statement?
    answer: 'To call an OpenROAD application from an image file:

      ```

      commit;

      call runimage(filename = ''runimage'', startcomponent = ''framename'');

      ```

      This calls the application in ''runimage'', starting at the frame specified in
      ''framename''.'
  - question: Write code to demonstrate error handling when using Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      Call Statement.
    answer: "Here's an example of error handling with a call statement:\n```\ncall rundbapp(application\
      \ = 'inventory', startcomponent = 'parts');\nif CurSession.CallSystemStatus !=\
      \ 0 then\n    message 'Error calling inventory application: ' || char(CurSession.CallSystemStatus);\n\
      endif;\n```\nThis checks the CurSession.CallSystemStatus after the call to handle\
      \ any errors."
