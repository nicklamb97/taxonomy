  - question: How to use the basic sleep statement to pause a program in Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD Sleep Statement?
    answer: 'Here''s how to use the basic sleep statement:

      ```

      sleep 5;

      ```

      This code pauses the program execution for 5 seconds.'
  - question: Write code to demonstrate using sleep within a loop in Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      Sleep Statement.
    answer: "Here's an example of using sleep within a loop:\n```\ni = integer;\ni =\
      \ 1;\nWHILE i <= 3 DO\n    MESSAGE i;\n    let i = i + 1;\n    sleep 2;\nENDWHILE;\n\
      ```\nThis code displays a message, increments i, and pauses for 2 seconds in each\
      \ iteration."
  - question: How to use sleep with an integer variable in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Sleep
      Statement?
    answer: 'Here''s how to use sleep with an integer variable:

      ```

      pause_duration = integer;

      pause_duration = 3;

      sleep pause_duration;

      ```

      This code pauses the program for the number of seconds specified in pause_duration.'
  - question: Write code to demonstrate using sleep before user input in Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD Sleep Statement.
    answer: 'Here''s an example of using sleep before user input:

      ```

      MESSAGE "Preparing to receive input...";

      sleep 3;

      user_input = prompt "Enter a number:";

      ```

      This code displays a message, waits for 3 seconds, then prompts for user input.'
  - question: How to create a simple countdown timer using sleep in Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      Sleep Statement?
    answer: "Here's a simple countdown timer using sleep:\n```\ncountdown = integer;\n\
      countdown = 5;\nWHILE countdown > 0 DO\n    MESSAGE \"Time remaining: \" || char(countdown);\n\
      \    sleep 1;\n    let countdown = countdown - 1;\nENDWHILE;\nMESSAGE \"Time's\
      \ up!\";\n```\nThis code creates a 5-second countdown, displaying the remaining\
      \ time each second."
  - question: Write code to show how sleep interacts with conditional statements in
      Actian 4GL OpenROAD Sleep Statement.
    answer: "Here's an example of sleep interacting with conditional statements:\n```\n\
      user_input = 10;\nIF user_input > 10 then\n    MESSAGE \"Input is greater than\
      \ 10.\";\n    sleep 2;\nELSE\n    MESSAGE \"Input is less than or equal to 10.\"\
      ;\n    sleep 1;\nENDIF;\nMESSAGE \"End of program.\";\n```\nThis code uses different\
      \ sleep durations based on the condition."
  - question: How to use sleep to create timed responses in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Sleep
      Statement?
    answer: "Here's how to create timed responses using sleep:\n```\nMESSAGE \"You have\
      \ 5 seconds to respond.\";\nsleep 5;\nresponse = prompt \"Enter your response:\"\
      ;\nIF response = \"\" THEN\n    MESSAGE \"Time's up! No response received.\";\n\
      ELSE\n    MESSAGE \"Response received: \" || response;\nENDIF;\n```\nThis code\
      \ gives the user 5 seconds to prepare before prompting for a response."
  - question: Write code to demonstrate error handling related to sleep in Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD Sleep Statement.
    answer: "Here's an example of error handling related to sleep:\n```\nduration =\
      \ integer;\nduration = prompt \"Enter sleep duration (in seconds):\";\nIF duration\
      \ <= 0 THEN\n    MESSAGE \"Invalid duration. Using default of 1 second.\";\n \
      \   duration = 1;\nENDIF;\nsleep duration;\nMESSAGE \"Resumed after \" || char(duration)\
      \ || \" second(s).\";\n```\nThis code handles invalid input for sleep duration."
  - question: How to use sleep to simulate a process with delays in Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      Sleep Statement?
    answer: 'Here''s how to simulate a process with delays:

      ```

      MESSAGE "Starting process...";

      sleep 2;

      MESSAGE "Step 1 complete";

      sleep 1;

      MESSAGE "Step 2 complete";

      sleep 1;

      MESSAGE "Step 3 complete";

      sleep 2;

      MESSAGE "Process finished.";

      ```

      This code simulates a multi-step process with varying delays between steps.'
  - question: Write code to show the blocking nature of sleep in Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      Sleep Statement.
    answer: 'Here''s an example showing the blocking nature of sleep:

      ```

      MESSAGE "Starting long operation...";

      sleep 5;

      MESSAGE "Long operation complete.";

      MESSAGE "This message appears after the sleep period.";

      ```

      This code demonstrates that no other operations occur during the sleep period.'
