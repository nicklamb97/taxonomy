  - question: What is the purpose of the sleep statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The sleep statement in Actian 4GL is used to pause program execution for a specified duration,
      typically in seconds.

  - question: How is the duration specified in the sleep statement?
    answer: |
      The duration in the sleep statement must be an integer literal or variable representing the
      number of seconds to pause.

  - question: Can the sleep duration be a fractional number?
    answer: |
      No, the sleep duration must be a whole number (integer) in Actian 4GL.

  - question: What happens during the sleep operation?
    answer: |
      During the sleep operation, the program execution is halted for the specified duration, after
      which it resumes from where it left off.

  - question: What are some typical use cases for using sleep in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      Sleep statements are often used to introduce delays in program execution, wait for user input,
      or pace actions within an application.

  - question: Is the sleep statement a blocking operation in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      Yes, the sleep statement blocks the program execution during the specified sleep duration.

  - question: How can developers handle timing requirements in Actian 4GL applications?
    answer: |
      Developers can use the sleep statement to meet timing requirements for operations such as
      polling, animation, or synchronization.

  - question: Can the sleep duration be dynamically determined at runtime?
    answer: |
      Yes, developers can calculate or retrieve the sleep duration from variables based on runtime
      conditions in Actian 4GL.

  - question: What is the effect of using a negative value or zero as the sleep duration?
    answer: |
      Using a negative value or zero as the sleep duration typically results in an immediate return
      from the sleep statement without pausing.

  - question: How does the sleep statement contribute to application performance in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      Proper use of the sleep statement helps in managing application responsiveness and resource
      utilization by introducing controlled delays.
