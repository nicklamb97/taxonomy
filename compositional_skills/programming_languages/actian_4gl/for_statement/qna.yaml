  - question: How to use a basic for loop to iterate through an array in Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD For Statement?
    answer: "Here's a basic for loop to iterate through an array:\n```\nfor i = 1 to\
      \ array.Lastrow do\n    arr[i].PaymentReceived = TRUE;\nendfor;\n```\nThis loop\
      \ sets PaymentReceived to TRUE for each element in the array."
  - question: Write code to demonstrate the use of the downto keyword in an Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD For Statement.
    answer: "Here's a for loop using the downto keyword:\n```\nfor i = 10 downto 1 do\n\
      \    message 'Countdown: ' || char(i);\nendfor;\n```\nThis loop counts down from\
      \ 10 to 1, displaying each number."
  - question: How to break out of a for loop using the endloop statement in Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD For Statement?
    answer: "Here's how to use endloop to break out of a for loop:\n```\nfor i = 1 to\
      \ arr.Lastrow do\n    if arr[i].Name = '' then\n        endloop;\n    endif;\n\
      \    /* Process non-empty names */\nendfor;\n```\nThis loop breaks out immediately\
      \ when an empty name is encountered."
  - question: Write code to demonstrate the use of the continue statement in an Actian
      4GL OpenROAD For Statement.
    answer: "Here's how to use the continue statement in a for loop:\n```\nfor i = 1\
      \ to arr.Lastrow do\n    if arr[i].Name = '' then\n        continue;\n    endif;\n\
      \    /* Process non-empty names */\nendfor;\n```\nThis loop skips processing for\
      \ empty names and continues with the next iteration."
  - question: How to use nested for loops with labels in Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement?
    answer: "Here's an example of nested for loops with labels:\n```\nlabel1: for i\
      \ = 1 to arr1.Lastrow do\n    label2: for j = 1 to arr2.Lastrow do\n        if\
      \ arr.Name = '' then\n            endloop label1;\n        elseif arr.FullTime\
      \ = FALSE then\n            endloop label2;\n        endif;\n    endfor;\nendfor;\n\
      ```\nThis code demonstrates nested loops with labeled endloop statements."
  - question: Write code to show how the endexpression is re-evaluated in each iteration
      of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement.
    answer: "Here's an example showing endexpression re-evaluation:\n```\nmax_value\
      \ = 10;\nfor i = 1 to max_value do\n    message 'Current value: ' || char(i);\n\
      \    if i = 5 then\n        max_value = 15;  /* Extends the loop */\n    endif;\n\
      endfor;\n```\nThis loop demonstrates how changing max_value affects the loop's\
      \ end condition."
  - question: How to use the resume statement to terminate both the loop and the current
      event block in Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement?
    answer: "Here's how to use the resume statement:\n```\nfor i = 1 to arr.Lastrow\
      \ do\n    if arr[i].ErrorCondition = TRUE then\n        message 'Error found.\
      \ Terminating process.';\n        resume;\n    endif;\n    /* Process normal conditions\
      \ */\nendfor;\n```\nThis loop terminates both the loop and the current event block\
      \ if an error condition is found."
  - question: Write code to demonstrate error handling within an Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      For Statement.
    answer: "Here's an example of error handling in a for loop:\n```\nfor i = 1 to arr.Lastrow\
      \ do\n    if arr[i].Value < 0 then\n        message 'Error: Negative value found\
      \ at index ' || char(i);\n        arr[i].Value = 0;  /* Reset to valid value */\n\
      \    endif;\n    /* Continue processing */\nendfor;\n```\nThis loop checks for\
      \ and handles negative values in the array."
  - question: How to use a for loop to perform a calculation in Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      For Statement?
    answer: "Here's a for loop performing a calculation:\n```\ntotal = 0;\nfor i = 1\
      \ to salesArray.Lastrow do\n    total = total + salesArray[i].Amount;\nendfor;\n\
      average = total / salesArray.Lastrow;\n```\nThis loop calculates the total and\
      \ average of sales amounts."
  - question: Write code to show how a for loop might not execute at all in Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD For Statement.
    answer: "Here's an example where a for loop might not execute:\n```\nstartValue\
      \ = 10;\nendValue = 5;\nfor i = startValue to endValue do\n    message 'This will\
      \ not be displayed';\nendfor;\nmessage 'Loop did not execute';\n```\nIn this case,\
      \ the loop doesn't execute because startValue is greater than endValue."
  - question: How to use the indexvariable within the loop body for different purposes
      in Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement?
    answer: "Here's how to use the indexvariable for different purposes:\n```\nfor i\
      \ = 1 to 10 do\n    if i mod 2 = 0 then\n        message 'Even number: ' || char(i);\n\
      \    else\n        message 'Odd number: ' || char(i);\n    endif;\n    arr[i].Position\
      \ = i * 10;\nendfor;\n```\nThis loop uses the indexvariable for conditionals and\
      \ calculations."
  - question: Write code to demonstrate breaking out of nested loops using labeled endloop
      in Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement.
    answer: "Here's how to break out of nested loops using labeled endloop:\n```\nouter:\
      \ for i = 1 to 5 do\n    inner: for j = 1 to 5 do\n        if i * j > 10 then\n\
      \            message 'Breaking out of both loops';\n            endloop outer;\n\
      \        endif;\n        message 'i = ' || char(i) || ', j = ' || char(j);\n \
      \   endfor;\nendfor;\n```\nThis code breaks out of both loops when their product\
      \ exceeds 10."
  - question: How to use the continue statement with labels in nested loops in Actian
      4GL OpenROAD For Statement?
    answer: "Here's how to use continue with labels in nested loops:\n```\nouter: for\
      \ i = 1 to 5 do\n    inner: for j = 1 to 5 do\n        if j = 3 then\n       \
      \     continue outer;\n        endif;\n        message 'i = ' || char(i) || ',\
      \ j = ' || char(j);\n    endfor;\nendfor;\n```\nThis code skips to the next iteration\
      \ of the outer loop when j equals 3."
  - question: Write code to show how the indexvariable's value is undefined upon exit
      from an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement.
    answer: "Here's an example showing the indexvariable's undefined value after the\
      \ loop:\n```\nfor i = 1 to 5 do\n    message 'Inside loop: i = ' || char(i);\n\
      endfor;\nmessage 'After loop: i = ' || char(i);  /* i's value is undefined here\
      \ */\n```\nThis code demonstrates that i's value is undefined after the loop ends."
  - question: How to use a for loop to initialize an array in Actian 4GL OpenROAD For
      Statement?
    answer: "Here's how to initialize an array using a for loop:\n```\nfor i = 1 to\
      \ 10 do\n    myArray[i].Value = i * 2;\n    myArray[i].IsEven = (i mod 2 = 0);\n\
      endfor;\n```\nThis loop initializes an array with calculated values and boolean\
      \ flags."
  - question: Write code to demonstrate the use of the return statement within an Actian
      4GL OpenROAD For Statement.
    answer: "Here's an example using the return statement within a for loop:\n```\n\
      procedure FindValue(searchValue = integer) =\nbegin\n    for i = 1 to dataArray.Lastrow\
      \ do\n        if dataArray[i] = searchValue then\n            return i;  /* Returns\
      \ the index and exits the procedure */\n        endif;\n    endfor;\n    return\
      \ 0;  /* Value not found */\nend\n```\nThis procedure searches for a value and\
      \ returns its index or 0 if not found."
  - question: How to use a for loop to reverse the elements of an array in Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD For Statement?
    answer: "Here's how to reverse an array using a for loop:\n```\nfor i = 1 to array.Lastrow\
      \ / 2 do\n    temp = array[i];\n    array[i] = array[array.Lastrow - i + 1];\n\
      \    array[array.Lastrow - i + 1] = temp;\nendfor;\n```\nThis loop swaps elements\
      \ from the start and end of the array, moving towards the center."
  - question: Write code to demonstrate boundary checking within an Actian 4GL OpenROAD
      For Statement.
    answer: "Here's an example of boundary checking in a for loop:\n```\nmaxSize = 100;\n\
      for i = 1 to inputArray.Lastrow do\n    if i > maxSize then\n        message 'Warning:\
      \ Max size exceeded. Truncating array.';\n        endloop;\n    endif;\n    processedArray[i]\
      \ = inputArray[i];\nendfor;\n```\nThis code checks if the loop exceeds a maximum\
      \ size and truncates the array if necessary."
  - question: How to use nested for loops to create a multiplication table in Actian
      4GL OpenROAD For Statement?
    answer: "Here's how to create a multiplication table using nested for loops:\n```\n\
      for i = 1 to 10 do\n    for j = 1 to 10 do\n        product = i * j;\n       \
      \ message char(i) || ' x ' || char(j) || ' = ' || char(product);\n    endfor;\n\
      endfor;\n```\nThis code generates a 10x10 multiplication table."
  - question: Write code to show how to use a for loop with a dynamic end condition
      in Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement.
    answer: "Here's an example of a for loop with a dynamic end condition:\n```\nendValue\
      \ = 10;\nfor i = 1 to endValue do\n    message 'Current value: ' || char(i);\n\
      \    if i = 5 then\n        endValue = 15;  /* Extends the loop */\n    endif;\n\
      endfor;\n```\nThis loop demonstrates how changing the end condition during iteration\
      \ affects the loop."
