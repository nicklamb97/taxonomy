  - question: How do you convert a basic Actian 4GL OpenROAD If-Then-Else Statement
      to C#?
    answer: Replace 'if' with 'if', 'then' with '{', 'else' with '} else {', and 'endif;'
      with '}'. Use '==' for equality comparison.
  - question: What's the C# equivalent of the Actian 4GL OpenROAD elseif clause?
    answer: 'Replace ''elseif'' with ''else if'' and structure it like: } else if (condition)
      {'
  - question: How do you handle nested if statements when converting from Actian 4GL
      OpenROAD to C#?
    answer: Maintain the nesting structure, replacing 'then' with '{' and 'endif;' with
      '}' for each level of nesting.
  - question: What's the C# equivalent of the Actian 4GL OpenROAD 'prompt' function
      in an if statement?
    answer: Use Console.Write() for the prompt and Console.ReadLine() to get user input.
      Assign the result to a variable.
  - question: How do you convert an Actian 4GL OpenROAD if statement checking for a
      null value to C#?
    answer: Replace the null check with '== null' in C#. For value types, use the nullable
      type (e.g., int?) and check with HasValue.
  - question: What's the C# equivalent of the Actian 4GL OpenROAD 'callframe' function
      in an if-then-else statement?
    answer: Replace 'callframe' with a method call. Define methods for each frame and
      call them based on the condition.
  - question: How do you handle multiple conditions in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD if statement
      when converting to C#?
    answer: 'Use the same logical operators: ''AND'' becomes ''&&'', ''OR'' becomes
      ''||''. Parentheses can be used for grouping conditions.'
