      "How to declare a dynamic array variable of type Emp in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic Array Variables?"
    answer: |
      "To declare a dynamic array variable of type Emp in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic Array Variables,
      use the following syntax:

      emparray = array of Emp;

      This declares an empty array named 'emparray' that can hold objects of the Emp class or its subclasses."
  - question: >
      "Write code to reference the title column of all rows in a dynamic array named movies in OpenROAD Actian 4GL
      Dynamic Array Variables."
    answer: |
      "To reference the title column of all rows in a dynamic array named movies in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic Array
      Variables, use the following syntax:

      movies[*].title

      This syntax allows you to work with the 'title' attribute across all objects in the 'movies' array. For example,
      you could use it in an event handler:

      on entry movies[*].title
          // Event handling code here
      endentry;"

      "How to pass an entire dynamic array as a parameter to a frame in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic Array Variables?"
    answer: |
      "To pass an entire dynamic array as a parameter to a frame in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic Array Variables, use the
      following syntax:

      callframe frame_name (parameter_name = array_name);

      For example, if you have an array named 'movies' and want to pass it to a frame named 'movie_list', you would
      write:

      callframe movie_list (mv_fld = movies);

      This passes the entire 'movies' array as a unit to the 'movie_list' frame."
  - question: >
      "Write code to reference an individual row in a dynamic array named employees in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic Array
      Variables."
    answer: |
      "To reference an individual row in a dynamic array named employees in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic Array Variables,
      use the following syntax:

      employees[n]

      Where 'n' is the number of the row you want to reference. For example, to pass the third row of the 'employees'
      array to a procedure named 'update_employee', you would write:

      callproc update_employee (emp_row = employees[3]);

      This allows you to work with the individual object (employee) in the specified row of the array."
  - question: >
      "How to reference a specific cell in a dynamic array in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic Array Variables?"
    answer: |
      "To reference a specific cell in a dynamic array in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic Array Variables, use the following
      syntax:

      arrayname[n].columnname

      Where 'arrayname' is the name of the array, 'n' is the row number, and 'columnname' is the name of the column
      (attribute) you want to access.

      For example, to reference the 'salary' of the 5th employee in an 'employees' array:

      employees[5].salary

      This syntax allows you to work with a specific attribute of a specific object in the array."
  - question: >
      "Write code to reference an attribute of a nested object within a dynamic array in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic
      Array Variables."
    answer: |
      "To reference an attribute of a nested object within a dynamic array in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic Array
      Variables, use the following syntax:

      arrayname[n].nestedobject.attribute

      For example, if you have an array named 'employees' where each employee has a nested object 'address', and you
      want to reference the 'city' attribute of the address for the 3rd employee, you would write:

      employees[3].address.city

      This allows you to access attributes of nested objects within the array elements."
  - question: >
      "How to reference an element in a nested array within a dynamic array in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic Array
      Variables?"
    answer: |
      "To reference an element in a nested array within a dynamic array in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic Array Variables,
      use the following syntax:

      arrayname[n].nestedarrayname[x].attribute

      Where:
      - 'arrayname' is the name of the outer array
      - 'n' is the row number in the outer array
      - 'nestedarrayname' is the name of the nested array
      - 'x' is the row number in the nested array
      - 'attribute' is the attribute you want to access

      For example, if you have an array 'departments' where each department has a nested array 'employees', and you want
      to access the 'name' of the 2nd employee in the 3rd department:

      departments[3].employees[2].name

      This syntax allows you to work with nested arrays within your dynamic arrays."

      "Write code to detect an Entry event on a column of a dynamic array displayed in a table field in OpenROAD Actian
      4GL Dynamic Array Variables."
    answer: |
      "To detect an Entry event on a column of a dynamic array displayed in a table field in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic
      Array Variables, use the following syntax:

      on entry arrayname[*].columnname
          // Event handling code here
      endentry;

      For example, to detect when a user enters the 'title' column of a 'movies' array displayed in a table field:

      on entry movies[*].title
          // This code will run when the user enters any cell in the 'title' column
          message 'Entering title field';
      endentry;

      This event handler will be triggered whenever the user enters any cell in the 'title' column of the 'movies' array
      in the table field."
  - question: >
      "How to declare a dynamic array with a default null value in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic Array Variables?"
    answer: |
      "To declare a dynamic array with a default null value in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic Array Variables, use the
      following syntax:

      arrayname = array of ClassName with default null;

      For example, to declare a dynamic array of Employee objects with a default null value:

      employeeArray = array of Employee with default null;

      This declaration creates an empty array where any new elements added to the array will have a default value of
      null until explicitly set to a non-null value."
  - question: >
      "Write code to pass a single row from a dynamic array to a procedure in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic Array
      Variables."
    answer: |
      "To pass a single row from a dynamic array to a procedure in OpenROAD Actian 4GL Dynamic Array Variables, use the
      following syntax:

      callproc procedure_name (parameter_name = arrayname[n]);

      For example, if you have a dynamic array named 'employees' and want to pass the 5th row to a procedure named
      'update_employee':

      callproc update_employee (emp_row = employees[5]);

      This code passes the object in the 5th row of the 'employees' array to the 'update_employee' procedure. The
      procedure can then work with this individual employee object."
