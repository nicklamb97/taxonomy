  - question: "How do you declare a nullable integer simple variable in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?"
    answer: "To declare a nullable integer simple variable in Actian 4GL OpenROAD, you can use the following syntax:
      ```
      i = integer;
      ```
      By default, all simple variables are nullable, so you don't need to explicitly specify 'with null'."
  - question: "Write code to declare and initialize a non-nullable varchar simple variable with a default
              value in Actian 4GL OpenROAD."
    answer: "Here's how to declare and initialize a non-nullable varchar simple variable with a default
              value in Actian 4GL OpenROAD:
      ```
      person = varchar not null default 'John Doe';
      ```
      This declares a varchar variable named 'person' that cannot be null and has a default value of 'John Doe'."
  - question: "How do you assign a value to a simple variable in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?"
    answer: "To assign a value to a simple variable in Actian 4GL OpenROAD, you use the assignment
            operator (=). Here's an example:
      ```
      person = 'Smith';
      ```
      This assigns the value 'Smith' to the variable named 'person'."
  - question: "Demonstrate how to use a simple variable as an element of a reference variable in Actian 4GL OpenROAD."
    answer: "Here's an example of using a simple variable as an element of a reference variable in Actian 4GL OpenROAD:
      ```
      -- Assuming 'film' is a reference variable with a 'Director' attribute
      film.Director = 'Hitchcock';
      ```
      In this example, 'Director' is a simple variable that is an element of the 'film' reference variable."
  - question: "Show how to use a simple variable as an element of an array variable in Actian 4GL OpenROAD."
    answer: "Here's an example of using a simple variable as an element of an array variable in Actian 4GL OpenROAD:
      ```
      -- Assuming 'movies' is an array with a 'Title' attribute
      if movies[].Title = 'ANNIE HALL' then
          -- Do something
      end if;
      ```
      In this example, 'Title' is a simple variable that is an element of the 'movies' array variable."
  - question: "How do you declare a non-nullable simple variable of type integer with a default
              value in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?"
    answer: "To declare a non-nullable simple variable of type integer with a default value in
            Actian 4GL OpenROAD, use the following syntax:
      ```
      counter = integer not null default 0;
      ```
      This declares an integer variable named 'counter' that cannot be null and has a default value of 0."
  - question: "Write code to declare a simple variable using a system constant as the default
              value in Actian 4GL OpenROAD."
    answer: "Here's how to declare a simple variable using a system constant as the default value
            in Actian 4GL OpenROAD:
      ```
      flag = integer not null default false;
      ```
      In this example, we're using the system constant 'false' as the default value for the 'flag' variable."
  - question: "Demonstrate how to declare multiple simple variables of different types in Actian 4GL OpenROAD."
    answer: "Here's how to declare multiple simple variables of different types in Actian 4GL OpenROAD:
      ```
      id = integer not null;
      name = varchar;
      age = integer default 0;
      is_active = integer not null default true;
      ```
      This declares four variables: an integer 'id', a nullable varchar 'name', an integer 'age'
      with a default value, and a non-nullable integer 'is_active' with a default value."
  - question: "How do you specify that a simple variable should not have a default value in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?"
    answer: "To specify that a simple variable should not have a default value in Actian 4GL OpenROAD,
            you can use the 'not default'
      clause. However, the documentation notes that this clause has no effect in OpenROAD and is only
      provided for syntactic compatibility with SQL. Here's an example:
      ```
      score = integer not default;
      ```
      Note that this declaration won't actually prevent a default value from being assigned in OpenROAD."
  - question: "Write code to declare a simple variable that can be null but has a non-null
              default value in Actian 4GL OpenROAD."
    answer: "Here's how to declare a simple variable that can be null but has a non-null default value
            in Actian 4GL OpenROAD:
      ```
      status = varchar default 'Active';
      ```
      This declares a varchar variable named 'status' that can be null (because 'not null' is not specified)
      but has a default value of 'Active'."
