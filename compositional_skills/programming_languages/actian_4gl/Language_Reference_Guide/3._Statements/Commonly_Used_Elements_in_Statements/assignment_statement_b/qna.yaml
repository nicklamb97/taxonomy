  - question: How do you assign a string value to a variable in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: "To assign a string value to a variable:\n```\nemployee_name = 'John Doe';\n```"

  - question: What happens if you assign a string to a variable that's shorter than the string?
    answer: "If you assign a string to a variable that's shorter than the string, OpenROAD truncates the string.
    For example:\n```\ndeclare short_var = char(5);\nshort_var = 'Too long';\n# Result: short_var = 'Too l'\n```"

  - question: How do you assign a value to an individual attribute of a reference variable?
    answer: "To assign a value to an individual attribute of a reference variable:
        ```
        newcustomer.Name = 'Smith';
        ```"

  - question: How can you assign a value to an individual element in an array?
    answer: "To assign a value to an individual element in an array:\n```\nclient[3].Address = '123 Main St';\n```"

  - question: What's the syntax for assigning null to a reference variable?
    answer: "To assign null to a reference variable:\n```\ncustomer_ref = null;\n```"

  - question: How do you assign one reference variable to another?
    answer: "To assign one reference variable to another:\n```\nnew_customer = existing_customer;\n```"

  - question: What's the rule for assigning reference variables of different classes?
    answer: "When assigning reference variables, the system class on the right side must be the same as, or a subclass
    of, the variable on the left. For example:\n```\nActiveField_var = EntryField_var;\n```"

  - question: How do you redirect an array variable to point to another array?
    answer: "To redirect an array variable to point to another array:\n```\ncurrent_clients = old_clients;\n```"

  - question: Can you assign a row reference from one array to another array? How?
    answer: "Yes, you can assign a row reference from one array to another. For example:
        ```
        new_array[5] = old_array[3];
        ```"

  - question: How do you assign values to multiple columns in a specific row of a dynamic array?

    \nchild[2].age = 7;\n```"

  - question: What's the syntax for assigning values to the current row of a table field?
    answer: "To assign values to the current row of a table field:\n```\nemployee[].name = 'Alice';\nemployee[].salary
    = 50000;\n```"

  - question: How do you assign a value to a numeric variable in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: "To assign a value to a numeric variable:\n```\ntotal_amount = 1234.56;\n```"

  - question: What happens if you assign a value outside the allowable range for a data type?
    answer: "If you assign a value outside the allowable range for a data type, OpenROAD will issue an error. Always
    ensure the assigned value is within the valid range for the variable's data type."

  - question: How can you assign the result of an expression to a variable?
    answer: "To assign the result of an expression to a variable:\n```\ntotal_cost = base_price + tax_amount +
    shipping_fee;\n```"

  - question: What's the effect of assigning one reference variable to another on the underlying object?
    answer: "When you assign one reference variable to another, both variables point to the same object. Changes made
    through either variable will affect the same underlying object and be visible through both variables."
