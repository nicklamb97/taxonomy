      outloop: for i = 1 to 10 do
          /* statements */
      endfor;
      ```

  - question: How do you break out of a for loop prematurely using endloop?
    answer: |
      To break out of a for loop prematurely:
      ```
      for i = 1 to 100 do
          if condition then
              endloop;
          endif;
          /* more statements */
      endfor;
      ```

  - question: How can you use the continue statement in a for loop?
    answer: |
      To use continue in a for loop:
      ```
      for i = 1 to 10 do
          if i mod 2 = 0 then
              continue;
          endif;
          message 'Odd number: ' + i;
      endfor;
      ```

  - question: How do you nest for loops in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      To nest for loops:
      ```
      for i = 1 to 3 do
          for j = 1 to 3 do
              message 'i=' + i + ', j=' + j;
          endfor;
      endfor;
      ```

  - question: How can you use a for loop to iterate through a dynamic array?
    answer: |
      To iterate through a dynamic array:
      ```
      for i = 1 to dynamicArray.Lastrow do
          processRecord(dynamicArray[i]);
      endfor;
      ```

  - question: How do you use the resume statement to exit a for loop and the current event block?
    answer: |
      To exit a for loop and the current event block:
      ```
      for i = 1 to 100 do
          if errorCondition then
              resume;
          endif;
          /* more statements */
      endfor;
      ```

  - question: How can you use a for loop with a step value other than 1?
    answer: |
      To use a for loop with a custom step value:
      ```
      for i = 0 to 100 by 10 do
          message 'Value: ' + i;
      endfor;
      ```

  - question: How do you use a for loop to populate a dropdown list?
    answer: |
      To populate a dropdown list:
      ```
      for i = 1 to optionsArray.Lastrow do
          dropdown.AddItem(optionsArray[i].option_text, optionsArray[i].option_value);
      endfor;
      ```

  - question: How can you use a labeled continue statement in nested for loops?
    answer: |
      To use a labeled continue in nested loops:
      ```
      outer: for i = 1 to 5 do
          inner: for j = 1 to 5 do
              if condition then

    answer: |
      To calculate a sum using a for loop:
      ```
      total = 0;
      for i = 1 to salesArray.Lastrow do
          total = total + salesArray[i].amount;
      endfor;
      ```

  - question: How can you use a for loop to reverse the elements of an array?
    answer: |
      To reverse array elements:
      ```
      for i = 1 to array.Lastrow / 2 do
          temp = array[i];
          array[i] = array[array.Lastrow - i + 1];
          array[array.Lastrow - i + 1] = temp;
      endfor;
      ```

  - question: How do you use a for loop to find the maximum value in an array?
    answer: |
      To find the maximum value in an array:
      ```
      max_value = array[1];
      for i = 2 to array.Lastrow do
          if array[i] > max_value then
              max_value = array[i];
          endif;
      endfor;
      ```
