  - question: >-
      How to use a procedure call in a loop condition in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Calling Procedures in Expressions?
    answer: |
      Use a procedure call in a loop condition like this:
      ```
      while is_data_available() do
          fetch_next_record();
      endwhile;
      ```
      This loop continues as long as the is_data_available() procedure returns true.

  - question: >-
      Write code to use a procedure call as part of an assignment expression in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Calling
      Procedures in Expressions.
    answer: |
      Use a procedure call in an assignment expression like this:
      ```
      discount_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_rate);
      ```
      This assigns the result of calculate_discount() to discount_price.

  - question: >-
      How to call a procedure that returns a boolean in a conditional statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Calling
      Procedures in Expressions?
    answer: |
      Call a procedure returning a boolean in a conditional statement like this:
      ```
      if is_valid_user(user_id) then
          grant_access();
      else
          deny_access();
      endif;
      ```
      This calls is_valid_user() to check a condition.

  - question: >-
      Write code to use a procedure call in a mathematical expression in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Calling Procedures
      in Expressions.
    answer: |
      Use a procedure call in a mathematical expression like this:
      ```
      final_amount = get_subtotal() + calculate_tax(get_subtotal());
      ```
      This adds the result of calculate_tax() to the result of get_subtotal().

  - question: >-
      How to use a procedure call inside a print statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Calling Procedures in
      Expressions?
    answer: |
      Use a procedure call in a print statement like this:
      ```
      print('The current time is: ' + get_current_time());
      ```
      This prints the result of get_current_time().

  - question: >-
      Write code to use a procedure call in a case statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Calling Procedures in
      Expressions.
    answer: |
      Use a procedure call in a case statement like this:
      ```
      case get_user_role(user_id)
          when 'Admin'
              grant_admin_privileges();
          when 'User'
              grant_user_privileges();
          else
              deny_access();
      endcase;
      ```
      This uses get_user_role() in a case statement.

  - question: >-
      How to call a procedure that returns a record type in an expression in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Calling
      Procedures in Expressions?
    answer: |
      Call a procedure returning a record type in an expression like this:
      ```
      declare
          emp_record = record of employee;
      enddeclare

      emp_record = get_employee_record(emp_id);
      ```
      This assigns the result of get_employee_record() to emp_record.

  - question: >-
      Write code to use a procedure call as a function argument in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Calling Procedures in
      Expressions.
    answer: |
      Use a procedure call as a function argument like this:
      ```
      log_activity(get_current_user(), 'Logged In');
      ```
      This calls get_current_user() and passes its result to log_activity().

  - question: >-
      How to use a procedure call in a string concatenation in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Calling Procedures in
      Expressions?
    answer: |
      Use a procedure call in string concatenation like this:
      ```
      message 'Welcome ' + get_username(user_id);
      ```
      This concatenates 'Welcome ' with the result of get_username().

  - question: >-
      Write code to use a procedure call in a date comparison in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Calling Procedures in
      Expressions.
    answer: |
      Use a procedure call in a date comparison like this:
      ```
      if get_current_date() > project_deadline then
          message 'Project is overdue';
      endif;
      ```
      This compares get_current_date() with project_deadline.

  - question: >-
      How to use a procedure call in an array assignment in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Calling Procedures in
      Expressions?
    answer: |
      Use a procedure call in an array assignment like this:
      ```
      declare
          result_array = array of integer;
      enddeclare

      result_array = get_prime_numbers(limit);
      ```
      This assigns the result of get_prime_numbers() to result_array.

  - question: >-
      Write code to use a procedure call in a structure field assignment in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Calling Procedures
      in Expressions.
    answer: |
      Use a procedure call in a structure field assignment like this:
      ```
      declare
          customer = record of customer_type;
      enddeclare

      customer.name = get_customer_name(customer_id);
      ```
      This assigns the result of get_customer_name() to customer.name.

  - question: >-
      How to use a procedure call in a logical expression in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Calling Procedures in
      Expressions?
    answer: |
      Use a procedure call in a logical expression like this:
      ```
      if is_logged_in() and has_permission('ACCESS_DASHBOARD') then
          open_dashboard();
      endif;
      ```
      This uses is_logged_in() and has_permission() in a logical expression.

  - question: >-
      Write code to use a procedure call in a comparison operation in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Calling Procedures
      in Expressions.
    answer: |
      Use a procedure call in a comparison operation like this:
      ```
      if get_order_count(customer_id) > 10 then
          apply_discount(customer_id);
      endif;
      ```
      This compares the result of get_order_count() with 10.

  - question: >-
      How to use a procedure call within another procedure call in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Calling Procedures in
      Expressions?
    answer: |
      Use a procedure call within another procedure call like this:
      ```
      send_notification(user_id, 'Your order ' + get_order_id() + ' has been shipped.');
      ```
      This uses get_order_id() within send_notification().
