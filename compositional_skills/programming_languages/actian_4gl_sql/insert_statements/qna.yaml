  - question: What is the basic syntax for an insert statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The basic syntax for an insert statement in Actian 4GL is:
      ```4gl
      insert into tablename [(columnname {, })]
      values(expression{, expression}) | subselect;
      ```
  - question: How do you use the values clause in an insert statement?
    answer: |
      The values clause specifies the values to be inserted:
      ```4gl
      insert into tablename (column1, column2)
      values(value1, value2);
      ```
      Example:
      ```4gl
      insert into projects(name, duedate)
      values(:projname, :enddate);
      commit;
      ```
  - question: What is the purpose of the repeated keyword in an insert statement?
    answer: |
      The repeated keyword directs the database to encode and save the query execution plan, providing performance
      benefits if you intend to execute this statement more than once. It is valid only for the Ingres DBMS.
  - question: When should you avoid using the repeated keyword in an insert statement?
    answer: |
      You should avoid using the repeated keyword if your statement uses a dynamic name for the table name, a column
      name, or in the subselect clause.
  - question: How do you insert computed values in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      To insert computed values, you can use expressions in the values clause:
      ```4gl
      repeated insert into personnel(name, sal)
      values(:name, :salary*1.1);
      ```
  - question: How do you use a subselect in an insert statement?
    answer: |
      The subselect clause retrieves values to be inserted from a select statement:
      ```4gl
      repeated insert into personnel(name, sal)
      select name, salary from contractor
      where name = :f_name and age = :f_age;
      commit;
      ```
  - question: What happens if you do not specify columns in an insert statement with a subselect?
    answer: |
      If you omit the list of database columns and use a subselect, the column types in the subselect must match the
      column types in the table in the order specified when the table was created.
  - question: How do you insert multiple rows from an array into a table in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      You can insert multiple rows from an array using a loop:
      ```4gl
      i = 1;
      while i <= emptable.LastRow do
          repeated insert into employee(name, age, salary)
          values(:emptable[i].name,
                 :emptable[i].age,
                 :emptable[i].salary);
          i = i + 1;
      endwhile;
      ```
  - question: What must be specified for columns defined as "not null not default" in an insert statement?
    answer: |
      Columns defined as "not null not default" must be specified in the insert statement. If they are not specified,
      you will receive an error and the statement will not be executed.
  - question: How does Actian 4GL handle unspecified columns that are nullable or defaultable in an insert statement?
    answer: |
      Columns that are nullable or defaultable can be specified or not as appropriate. If unspecified, they receive
      default values, which are null for nullable columns, blank for character data type columns, and zero for numeric
      columns.
